  "title": "The role of resveratrol in neurogenesis: a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RV) is a natural compound found in grapes, wine, berries, and peanuts and has potential health benefits-namely, neurogenesis improvement. Neurogenesis, which is the process through which new neurons or nerve cells are generated in the brain, occurs in the subventricular zone and hippocampus and is influenced by various factors. RV has been shown to increase neural stem cell proliferation and survival, improving cognitive function in hippocampus-dependent tasks. Thus, to provide a convergent and unbiased conclusion of the available evidence on the correlation between the RV and neurogenesis, a systematic review needs to be undertaken meticulously and with appropriate attention.",
