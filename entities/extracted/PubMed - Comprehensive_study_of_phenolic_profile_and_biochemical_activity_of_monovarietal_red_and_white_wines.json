  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of commercially available monovarietal red and white wines from Fru\u0161ka Gora mountain in Serbia, conducted to characterize their chemical and biochemical properties. Namely, 72 wines of 18 different Vitis vinifera varieties, including international, domestic and autochthonous ones, were assessed. Phenolic profile of wines was determined qualitatively, using spectrophotometric methods, and quantitatively, using LC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV/VIS methods. Quantified phenolic compounds pointed out differences between red and white wines, where some compounds stood out as distinctive characteristic of analyzed varieties, while others served as chemotaxonomic markers of the Fru\u0161ka Gora region. Antioxidant and inhibitory properties towards acetylcholinesterase were evaluated for all wines and their relation to phenolic composition was investigated. This study is valuable since chemical and biochemical properties of domestic and autochthonous Fru\u0161ka Gora varieties are reported for the first time. Also, international varieties studied herein gave distinctive information about the terroir of Fru\u0161ka Gora region, which is scarce in scientific literature.",
