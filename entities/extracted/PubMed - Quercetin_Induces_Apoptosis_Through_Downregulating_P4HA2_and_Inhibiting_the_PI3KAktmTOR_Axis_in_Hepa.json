  "title": "Quercetin Induces Apoptosis Through Downregulating P4HA2 and Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells: An In\u00a0Vitro Study.",
  "abstract": "Quercetin is a natural product with multiple activities, which possesses a promising antitumor effect on malignancies. The involvement of proline 4-hydroxylase II (P4HA2) in collagen synthesis is crucial in the growth of tumor cells. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death requisite for the stability of the intracellular environment. However, the relationship between quercetin and cell apoptosis, as well as the impact of P4HA2 in this connection, has not yet been specified in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).",
