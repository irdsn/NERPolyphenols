  "abstract": "The olive oil industry recently introduced a novel multi-phase decanter with the \"Leopard DMF\" series, which gives a by-product called p\u00e2t\u00e9, made up of pulp and olive wastewater with a high content of phenolic substances and without pits. This study aims to create a new culture medium, the Olive Juice Broth (OJB), from DMF p\u00e2t\u00e9, and apply it to select bacteria strains able to survive and degrade the bitter substances normally present in the olive fruit. Thirty-five different bacterial strains ofLactiplantibacillus plantarumfrom the CREA-IT.PE Collection of Microorganisms were tested. Seven strains characterized by \u226550% growth in OJB (B31, B137, B28, B39, B124, B130, and B51) showed a degradation of the total phenolic content of OJB \u2265 30%. From this set,L. plantarumB51 strain was selected as a starter for table olive production vs. spontaneous fermentation. The selected inoculant effectively reduced the debittering time compared to spontaneous fermentation. Hydroxytyrosol, derived from oleuropein and verbascoside degradation, and tyrosol, derived from ligstroside degradation, were produced faster than during spontaneous fermentation. The OJB medium is confirmed to be useful in selecting bacterial strains resistant to the complex phenolic environment of the olive fruit.",
