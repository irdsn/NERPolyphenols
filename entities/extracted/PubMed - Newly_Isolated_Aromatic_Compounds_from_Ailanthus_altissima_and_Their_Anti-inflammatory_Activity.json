  "abstract": "Five newly isolated aromatic natural products were isolated from the bark of Ailanthus altissima. These include two benzoic derivatives (1and2), a benzoquinone analogue (3), and a pair of lignan enantiomers [(\u00b1)-4]. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously through spectral evidence and chemical calculations. Notably, compound3exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects bothin vitroandin vivo, as it reduced the secretion of proinflammatory factors at a concentration of 15 \u03bcM. Results from Western blotting, in conjunction with molecular dynamics analysis, indicate that the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling pathways may partially explain the anti-inflammatory activity of compound3.",
