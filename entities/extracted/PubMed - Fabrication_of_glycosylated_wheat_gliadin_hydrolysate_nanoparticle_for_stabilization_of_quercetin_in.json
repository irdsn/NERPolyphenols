  "abstract": "This study examined the impact of enzymolysis and glycosylation modification on the formation mechanism, structural changes and stability of the protein-quercetin nanoparticles. In comparison with wheat gliadin hydrolysates (WGH), glycosylated wheat gliadin hydrolysates (MWH) exhibited a tendency towards a more relaxed structure and better hydrophilicity. The flexible structure of protein caused a binding mode alteration of the complex, which changed from hydrophobic interaction (WGH) to hydrogen bonding (MWH). MWH exhibited enhanced binding capacity and higher encapsulation rate (84.3\u00a0%) for quercetin. Furthermore, the stability and bioaccessibility of quercetin was also significantly improved. The presence of soft protein crowns was observed during digestion via transmission electron microscopy. Correlation analyses demonstrated a strong correlation between the strength of the protein-quercetin interaction and changes in protein conformation. The present finding provides a novel framework for the development of composite modifications of proteins as functional food nanocarriers.",
