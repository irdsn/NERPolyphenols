  "abstract": "Glycolysis serves as the principal metabolic pathway through which tumor cells derive their energy. Targeting glycolysis to disrupt the energy supply at its origin presents a promising strategy for inhibiting tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis. In this study, we developed a nanocomposite drug, ZIF-90@DOX@AP@PEG (ZDAP), utilizing zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-90) as carriers responsive to the tumor microenvironment (TME). This system co-delivers the glycolysis inhibitor apigenin (AP) alongside the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX), facilitating a triple-combination therapy approach for breast cancer treatment. ZIF-90 serves a dual role as a microwave (MW) sensitizer and as a responsive agent that degrades under TME-specific conditions, such as low pH and elevated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, thereby facilitating controlled drug release. Experimental investigations, both in vitro and in vivo, have shown that the synergistic integration of MW hyperthermia, chemotherapy, and glycolysis inhibition substantially surpasses the effectiveness of individual therapies. These results highlight the potential of glycolysis inhibition to augment the efficacy of multimodal cancer treatments and propose a novel strategy for the integration of glycolytic inhibition with other therapeutic modalities.",
