  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are increasingly prevalent among aging populations. Oxidative stress contributes to these diseases, leading to cellular damage and neuronal death. Natural antioxidants are being explored as preventive measures. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of natural antioxidants in delaying the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases by identifying their specific mechanisms of action. A comprehensive review of existing literature was conducted, focusing on studies that examine the role of natural antioxidants in neuroprotection. Key natural antioxidants, including flavonoids, polyphenls, vitamins C and E, and omega-3 fatty acids, were reviewed and analyzed for their bioavailability, mechanisms of action, and outcomes in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Additionally, clinical trials involving human subjects were considered to provide insights into the translational\u00a0implications of antioxidant consumption. The findings suggest that several natural antioxidants exhibit neuroprotective properties by modulating oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, and promoting neuronal survival. For instance, flavonoids such as quercetin and resveratrol have shown promise in enhancing cognitive function and mitigating the pathophysiological alterations associated with neurodegeneration. In clinical studies, higher intakes of dietary antioxidants were correlated with a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Natural antioxidants offer potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases by counteracting oxidative stress and maintaining cellular integrity. Overall, our report recommends that\u00a0further research is needed to optimize dosages and understand their\u00a0long-term benefits.",
