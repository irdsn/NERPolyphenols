  "abstract": "Sepsis is a critical condition triggered by infection and characterized by systemic inflammation and subsequent multiorgan failure. Chaihuang Qingfu Pill (CHQF), an in-hospital formulation developed by Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, is derived from the traditional Chinese medicine compound Qingyi Decoction through optimized herbal compatibility. It possesses pharmacological activities including heat-clearing and purgation, choleretic and anti-jaundice effects, as well as Qi-regulation and mass-resolving properties. Clinically, CHQF is primarily used in the treatment of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis, and has shown potential therapeutic effects in alleviating sepsis-associated liver injury. However, the precise molecular mechanisms and omics-based investigations of CHQF in the context of sepsis remain poorly understood. The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway serves as a central regulatory hub of the inflammatory response. Its activation leads to the excessive expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, thereby exacerbating tissue damage and promoting the progression of inflammatory diseases. Consequently, targeting the NF-\u03baB pathway may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of sepsis. This study aims to systematically investigate the molecular basis of CHQF in the mitigation of sepsis-associated liver damage.",
