  "abstract": "This systematic review was aimed at examining the impact of extraction methods on the phytochemical profile ofMoringa oleiferaleaves to identify the most effective extraction technique for food application. Mainly, maceration, Soxhlet extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) are reviewed in this study for their efficiency in extracting key phytochemicals inM. oleiferaleaves. Given the rich phytochemical profile ofM. oleiferaleaves, selecting an appropriate extraction method is important in preserving their functionality and ensuring the quality of fortified or enriched food products. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, this review found that maceration is the most efficient method for the extraction of gallic acid, which can enhance certain food textures but may also increase hardness in products such as cream cheese; Soxhlet extraction is effective in the extraction of kaempferol but slightly diminishes the sensory attributes in beverages such as malt drinks; and the UAE method is efficient in achieving the highest yield of quercetin while maintaining desirable sensory and textural properties. Overall, these findings suggest that the interaction between phytochemicals fromM. oleiferaleaves and the food matrix can affect the sensory and functional properties of the final product. Further optimization of each extraction technique is required to maximize the potential ofM. oleiferaleaf extracts in food applications.",
