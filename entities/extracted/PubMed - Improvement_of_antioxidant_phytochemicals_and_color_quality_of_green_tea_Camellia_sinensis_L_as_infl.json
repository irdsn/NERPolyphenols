  "abstract": "Cold plasma (CP) was investigated as an innovative method to enhance green tea (Camellia sinensis) quality by improving extraction efficiency, bioactive retention. This study optimized dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) CP using air, argon, and nitrogen at 14, 18, and 22\u2009kV for 6, 9, and 12\u2009min to improve extraction and the qualitative and quantitative properties of green tea.",
