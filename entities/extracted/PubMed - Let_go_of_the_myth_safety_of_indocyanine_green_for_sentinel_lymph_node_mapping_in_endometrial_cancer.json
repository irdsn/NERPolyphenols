  "abstract": "Sentinel lymph node mapping by intracervical indocyanine green injection is the preferred method for surgical staging in endometrial cancer. Adverse reactions to indocyanine green are extremely rare, and information about the safety of this tracer in patients with a history of other allergies, asthma, or comorbidities is limited. We aim to evaluate the rate of adverse reactions to indocyanine green injected during sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with endometrial cancer and review the etiology of such reactions.",
