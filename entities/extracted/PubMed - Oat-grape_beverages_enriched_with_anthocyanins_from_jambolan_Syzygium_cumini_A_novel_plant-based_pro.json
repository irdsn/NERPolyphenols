  "abstract": "This study aimed to develop and evaluate probiotic beverages formulated with water-soluble oat extract, grape pulp, 3\u00a0% or 5\u00a0% jambolan extract (JE), and inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA14. Over 28\u00a0days of refrigerated storage, the beverages were assessed for their probiotic count, physicochemical characterization, antioxidant activity, and inhibition of digestive enzymes. Furthermore, the probiotic survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the sensory acceptance were investigated. The anthocyanin-enriched beverages maintained probiotic viability of 14.10-13.50 log CFU/mL and retained levels above 9 log CFU/mL during storage. At the end of storage, antioxidant activity by ABTS radical scavenging improved from 8.08 to 134.75\u00a0\u03bcmol Trolox/mL, while \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition increased from 16.24\u00a0% to 52.37\u00a0% with JE addition. Sensory analysis revealed that the beverage containing 3\u00a0% JE achieved an overall acceptance of 67.7\u00a0%, comparable to the control (68.1\u00a0%). These findings support the potential of these beverages as novel plant-based probiotic functional foods.",
