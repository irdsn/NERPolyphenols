  "abstract": "Silicosis, a prevalent occupational disease caused by exposure to silica particles, currently lacks effective treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its millennia of clinical application, offers potential therapeutic solutions. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of astragaloside IV (ASV) combined with quercetin (QUE) in silicosis, particular focus on their possible mechanisms involving autophagy modulation and pyroptosis regulation.",
