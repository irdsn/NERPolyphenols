  "abstract": "Selection of an appropriate extraction method and stabilization of anthocyanins are particularly important for their stability. In this study, microwave-assisted extraction using different process times (5-30\u202fmin) and power (300-700\u202fW) was applied to recover red onion skin bioactive ingredients. Anthocyanin content, antioxidative capacity, and total phenolic content were strongly influenced by microwave extraction parameters. The extract was encapsulated using a complex coacervation method with different gelatin: pectin ratio and pH values. Maximum turbidity and coacervation yield were obtained at a 1:1 ratio of gelatin-pectin at pH\u202f=\u202f3.5, with the zeta potential of gelatin-pectin dispersions varied from -20 to +16\u202fmV. The encapsulation efficiency values ranged from 30 to 80\u202f%. Studying the release of anthocyanins in different food simulants indicated that the release behavior followed Fickian diffusion. These findings suggest that the microwave extraction of anthocyanins from red onion is a suitable method of recovery of these compounds, and coacervation by pectin-gelation biopolymers provides a sustained delivery of the compounds into nutraceutical food.",
