  "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of different pre- and post-fermentation maceration durations on the chemical and sensory characteristics of white wines made from PIWI (Pilzwiderstandsf\u00e4hige) grape varieties. The volatile profile of the wines was significantly altered, according to the time and stage of maceration. Wines made with pre-fermentation maceration showed a notable increase in the levels of terpenes and esters, and wines from post-fermentation maceration resulted in an increase in oxidation and aging compounds. Projective mapping revealed distinctions in the wines as a function of time and stage of maceration. Wines made with pre-fermentation maceration exhibited floral attributes, citrus and white fruits, and typical varietal aromas. Wine made with post-fermentation maceration showed more complex attributes, such as notes of honey, almonds, freshly cut grass, and apricot. These results provide a basis for developing oenological practices that can contribute to the production of wines with distinct sensory identity.",
