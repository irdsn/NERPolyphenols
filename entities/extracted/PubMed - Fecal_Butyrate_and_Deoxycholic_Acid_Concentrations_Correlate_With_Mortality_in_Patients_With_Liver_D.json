  "abstract": "The intestinal microbiome produces metabolites, including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids (BAs), that impact host physiology. Loss of intestinal microbiome diversity is associated with cirrhosis progression, but the impact of microbiome-associated metabolites on liver disease remains largely undefined. We aimed to correlate fecal metabolite concentrations with the severity and progression of liver disease.",
