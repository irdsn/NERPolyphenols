  "abstract": "The perception of polyphenols as a safe, healthy, and sustainable solution for replacing synthetic antioxidants has been an important factor for their rapid growing in the global food market. Therefore, it is essential to use reliable methods for their quantification in commercial products intended for animal or human consumption. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of some solvents used for the extraction of selected polyphenols, explore their stability under different experimental conditions, and validate a liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry method for their quantification in commercial fish feed ingredients by using the standard addition method. The regression models for gallic acid, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, oleuropein, carnosol and carnosic acid were linear in the range 0-30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, limit of detection and quantification around 0.03 and 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively, and accuracy within\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0% of the nominal concentrations. The method was successfully applied to the determination of specific polyphenols in commercial fish feed ingredients supplemented with polyphenols from olive and rosemary extracts.",
