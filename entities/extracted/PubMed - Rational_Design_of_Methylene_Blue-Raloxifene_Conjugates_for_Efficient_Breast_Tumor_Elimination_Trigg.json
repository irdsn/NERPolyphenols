  "abstract": "Small molecules capable of degrading estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) are of significant interest in breast cancer treatment. Herein, we rationally designed a series of ER\u03b1 degraders (MR1-MR3) by conjugating methylene blue, a bifunctional photosensitizer, with the raloxifene pharmacophore. The lead compoundMR3exhibited high affinity to ER\u03b1, and it can induce a complete depletion of ER\u03b1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells after 660 nm irradiation (0.4 W/cm2) for 1 min. Owing to the ER\u03b1 degradation merit,MR3displayed a 45-fold boosted anticancer activity (IC50= 0.55 \u03bcM) after irradiation. In the breast cancer xenograft mouse model,MR3induced an obvious tumor regression (tumor growth inhibition = 118%), which was superior to that of the FDA-approved ER\u03b1 degraderFaslodex. These important features makeMR3extremely intriguing for breast cancer treatment.",
