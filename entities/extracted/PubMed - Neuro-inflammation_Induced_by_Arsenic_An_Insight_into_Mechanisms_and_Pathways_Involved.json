  "title": "Neuro-inflammation Induced by Arsenic: An Insight into Mechanisms and Pathways Involved.",
  "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the progression of various neurological disorders, with chronic exposure to environmental toxicants like arsenic emerging as a major contributor. This review focuses on arsenic-induced neuroinflammation, highlighting its underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways, global epidemiological burden, and current strategies for effective management. Arsenic groundwater contamination, particularly prevalent in Asian countries, poses a significant health risk to millions across more than 100 nations. Chronic exposure to arsenic generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering oxidative stress and activating microglia, the key drivers of neuroinflammation. This cascade promotes proinflammatory cytokine release, leading to cognitive and neurological impairments. This review examines the underlying mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Additionally, this review highlights current therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating arsenic-induced neurotoxicity, including chelation therapy, natural antioxidants, and supplementation with essential trace elements. By addressing the multifactorial mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced neuroinflammation, the review emphasizes the urgent need for integrated public health initiatives and targeted interventions to alleviate the neurological consequences of chronic arsenic exposure.",
