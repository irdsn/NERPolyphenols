  "abstract": "Avicennia marina, (Forssk.) Vierh. the most common halo-tolerant plant, is rich in polyphenolic compounds such as phenols, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, and steroids. Avicennia marina exhibits significant therapeutic potential, including antioxidants, antiviral, immunosuppressive, and anticancer properties. Numerous halo-tolerant plant metabolites have been examined for their anti-cancer effects; nevertheless, their efficacy against Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive malignant neoplasm, remains poorly understood.",
