  "abstract": "Moringa oleifera, widely recognized as the \"miracle tree,\" has garnered significant scientific interest due to its exceptional nutritional, medicinal, and industrial properties. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of its\u00a0potential as a sustainable feed additive, antimicrobial agent, functional food ingredient, and a bioresource for agricultural and industrial advancements. Enriched with high-quality proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds,M.\u00a0oleiferaexhibits remarkable benefits in aquaculture, livestock production, and human nutrition. Its potent immunomodulatory, antifungal, antidiabetic, and antimicrobial properties further underscore its therapeutic significance in disease prevention and health promotion. Additionally, its ecological advantages, including soil enrichment, natural pest control, and wastewater purification, highlight its pivotal role in fostering environmental sustainability. A comprehensive investigation over the past five years has consistently validated its effective insecticidal efficacy, further expanding its agricultural applications. The efficacy ofM.\u00a0oleiferabioactive compounds is profoundly influenced by extraction methodologies. Advanced techniques such as ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and enzymatic-assisted extraction (EAE) significantly enhance the yield, purity, and bioavailability of phytochemicals, optimizing their pharmacological and industrial applications. The selection of an appropriate extraction strategy is crucial to preserving bioactivity and ensuring maximum efficacy in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and functional food formulations. Despite its vast potential, challenges such as the presence of anti-nutritional factors, variations in nutrient composition due to differing cultivation and processing methods, and the absence of standardized dosage guidelines require further investigation. Future research should focus on optimizing inclusion levels in animal and human diets, elucidating molecular mechanisms of action, and advancing green extraction technologies to enhance its efficacy and sustainability. This study highlights the multifaceted applications ofM.\u00a0oleiferaacross diverse sectors and its potential to revolutionize sustainable agriculture, healthcare, and environmental conservation. Addressing existing challenges through cutting-edge research and technological innovation will unlock its full potential as a key natural resource for enhancing global food security, promoting sustainable development, and pioneering pharmaceutical breakthroughs. By integrating information from recent five-year literature from 2019 to 2024, this work offers\u00a0a roadmap for future study, addressing significant challenges and outlining prospective avenues for the development of novel therapeutic and pest control approaches exploitingM.\u00a0oleifera.",
