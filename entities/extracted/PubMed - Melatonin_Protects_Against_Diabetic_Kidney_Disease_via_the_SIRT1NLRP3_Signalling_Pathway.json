  "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Melatonin, a hormone with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, has demonstrated potential in mitigating diabetic complications; however, its specific effects and mechanisms in DKD remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of melatonin on podocyte injury and renal damage in DKD and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.",
