  "abstract": "Tea wine has garnered significant attention due to its unique fusion of tea and wine flavors, as well as its alleged health benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effects of various treatments on the physicochemical properties of tea wine, including viable cell counts, pH, acidity, total ester content, tea polyphenol content, and volatile flavoring substances during the storage period. The findings indicated that tea wine subjected to low-temperature plasma (LTPS) treatment exhibited superior quality maintenance and an enhanced tea polyphenol content compared to untreated, UV-treated, and HTHP-treated tea wine. Analysis of volatile compounds revealed that the LTPS group exhibited the highest relative content of alcohols and esters (89.72%) during storage, thereby enhancing the fruity and sweet aroma of the tea wine. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of low-temperature plasma technology in the storage of tea wine.",
