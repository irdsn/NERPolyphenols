  "abstract": "The burn wounds are particularly susceptible to bacterial infection, while the hydrogel wound dressings with antibacterial property are expected to promote burn wound repairing progress. In this research, carboxymethyl cellulose bearing hydrazide groups and hemostatic polyphosphate moiety (CHP) was synthesized and cross-linked with dopamine grafted oxidized pectin (OPD) to prepare hemostatic self-healing hydrogel for burn wound repairing. Polydopamine coated graphene oxide (PGO) was loaded into the hydrogel to endow it with photothermal stimulated antibacterial property and enhanced the ROS scavenging ability, which can inhibit bacterial infection and promote tissue regeneration. Moreover, the loaded tannic acid (TA) further enhanced the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the hydrogel. As a result, the photothermal property of PGO and TA greatly reduced bacterial infection and promoted cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, the composite PGO/TA/Gel hydrogel exhibited satisfactory therapeutic effect in burn wound healing in mice model through reducing inflammation response, enhance the collagen deposition and promote angiogenesis based on histological analysis. These advantages make this composite hydrogel great potential applications in the field of wound dressings in biomedication.",
