  "abstract": "Cold exposure (CE) affects the growth and health of poultry. Resveratrol (RES) exerts antioxidation and anti-inflammation functions and is used as a feed additive to reduce the impact of environmental factors on poultry. To explore the impacts of CE on broiler heart and the protentional protective effect of RES, 360 twenty-one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were housed under the normal ambient temperature (CON, 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C) or CE temperature at 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0h/day at days 28-42, and provided the basal diet supplemented with RES at graded levels (0, 250, 500, and 750\u00a0mg RES/kg diet) from days 21-42. The results showed that CE reduced body weight gain and caused inflammatory cells infiltration and inflammation by upregulating NF-\u03baBp65, COX-2, and iNOS at both mRNA and protein levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CE caused apoptosis by upregulating Bax, Cyt C, Caspase 3, and Caspase 9 and downregulating Bcl2 mRNA and protein expression and Bcl2/Bax ratio (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and destroyed energy metabolism homeostasis by decreasing HK2 and LDHA mRNA and protein expression and downregulating HK1, LDHB, PFK, PK, and SDHB mRNA expression in the heart (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CE upregulated p38 and inhibited PI3K and AKT mRNA and protein expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, RES supplemented into the diet with a dosage of 500\u00a0mg/kg feed could significantly improve body weight gain of broilers, reduce inflammatory response and apoptosis, and enhance energy metabolism in cold-exposed broiler heart (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) through regulation of the p38-PI3K/AKT-NF-\u03baB axis. Overall, this experiment reveals the protective effects of RES on cardiac injury and energy metabolism disorder caused by cold exposure in broilers. Therefore, dietary RES supplementation is a practical strategy to mitigate the adverse impacts of cold on broilers reared in cold regions.",
