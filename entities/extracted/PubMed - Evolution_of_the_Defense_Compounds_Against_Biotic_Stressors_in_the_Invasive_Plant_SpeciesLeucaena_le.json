  "abstract": "Leucaena leucocephala(Lam.) de Wit is listed in the world's 100 worst alien invasive species because of the risks it poses to native plant communities. Life history traits, such as high growth and reproductive rates, and a high capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions may contribute to its invasive properties. Biotic stressors, such as herbivores, pathogens, and competing plant species are known to exert significant selective pressure on the plant's survival, distribution, and abundance.L. leucocephalahas been reported to contain several compounds involved in the defense functions against these biotic stressors. A large amount of L-mimosine, a non-protein amino acid, was found in all plant parts ofL. leucocephala, including its flowers. L-Mimosine is toxic to herbivorous mammals and insects, parasitic nematodes, pathogenic fungi, and neighboring competing plant species by inactivating various essential enzymes and blocking DNA replication, and/or inducing oxidative stress conditions. Several flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds, and/or derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids are toxic to parasitic nematodes, pathogenic fungi and bacteria, and competing plant species by disrupting plasma membrane structures and functions, and various metabolic processes. These compounds may represent the invasive traits ofL. leucocephalathat have undergone natural selection during the evolution of the species. They may contribute to the defense functions against the biotic stressors, and increase its survival, distribution, and abundance in the introduced ranges. This is the first review to focus on the compounds involved in the defense functions against biotic stressors.",
