  "abstract": "This study hypothesized that polyphenol-rich Duea Ching fruit extract (DCE) could enhance the oxidative and physical stabilities of oil-in-water emulsions. Antioxidant potential of ethanolic DCE was examined and the quality of Asian seabass oil-in-water emulsions incorporated with DCE at 1\u00a0% and 3\u00a0% was determined during 24\u00a0days. DCE using 60\u00a0% ethanol as extracting medium was rich in polyphenols. (\u00b1)-catechin and procyanidin B2 were dominant when analyzed via LC/MS with negative and positive ion modes. It showed DPPH, ABTS, peroxyl radical and H\u2082O\u2082 scavenging, along with ORAC and MCA. Emulsions containing 3\u00a0% DCE demonstrated improved stability, with smaller droplet size, and lower flocculation and coalescence index than the control. Lipid oxidation was significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), as confirmed by FTIR. Additionally, the 3\u00a0% DCE emulsion retained more polyunsaturated fatty acids and showed lower formation of hexanal and 2,4-heptadienal during storage. Thus, DCE could be promising antioxidant in emulsion.",
