  "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a pathological phenomenon that occurs after coronary blood flow restoration and poses a threat to patients' lives. Its mechanisms are closely related to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Yellow Wine Polyphenolic Compounds, a dietary polyphenol with significant antioxidant effects, have been shown to offer protection in various cardiovascular diseases. However, their role in MIRI remains under-researched.",
