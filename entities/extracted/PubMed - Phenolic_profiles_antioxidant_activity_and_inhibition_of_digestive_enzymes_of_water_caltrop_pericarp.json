  "abstract": "Water caltrop (Trapa natans L.) is widely cultivated as a popular vegetable or fruit in Asian countries. In China, water caltrop pericarp is also used as a functional food to treat metabolic syndrome. However, the profiling of bioactive substances and their pharmacological activities in different water caltrop varieties remains to be investigated. In the present study, three varieties of water caltrop pericarps collected from 13 origins in China were analyzed for their phenolic substances. To investigate the pharmacological activities, samples were tested for their free radical scavenging capacity and inhibitory potency against \u03b1-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase.",
