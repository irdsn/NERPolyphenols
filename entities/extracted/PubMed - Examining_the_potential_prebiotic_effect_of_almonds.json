  "abstract": "Almonds, a nutrient-dense food rich in dietary fiber, polyphenols, and unsaturated fatty acids, exhibit significant potential as a functional food with prebiotic effects. Prebiotics selectively stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial gut microbiota, leading to improved gut and systemic health. This review synthesizes evidence from in vitro studies, clinical trials, and systematic reviews to elucidate the prebiotic effects of almond consumption. Almonds enhance gut microbiota diversity and composition, particularly increasing beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Roseburia, while promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which are critical for gut barrier integrity and inflammation modulation. The presence of polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins, contributes to their antioxidative and antimicrobial properties, further supporting microbiome health. Despite variability in study outcomes, likely due to differences in population health status, study design, and almond preparation methods, the cumulative findings underscore almonds' role as a potential prebiotic food with the potential to improve cardiovascular health. Continued research focusing on individualized responses and standardized methodologies is essential to fully harness the health benefits of almond consumption.",
