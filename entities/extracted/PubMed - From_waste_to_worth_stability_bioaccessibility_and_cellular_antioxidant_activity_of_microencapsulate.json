  "abstract": "Red grape pomace (RGP) is a recognized winery by-product due to its phenolic profile with valuable antioxidant power and beneficial health properties. Following the latest trends in food science and technology, this study valorizes the use of RGP to obtain a food ingredient rich in antioxidant phenolics. An integrated approach was proposed, investigating the production by spray drying of easy-to-handle microparticles, rich in stable compounds with antioxidant properties demonstrated after simulated digestion using in vitro assays and Caco-2 cells. The changes in microbiota composition after fermentation were also studied.",
