  "title": "The Antiaging Potential of Dietary Plant-Based Polyphenols: A Review on Their Role in Cellular Senescence Modulation.",
  "abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions and an increased risk of chronic diseases. A key mechanism of this process is cellular senescence, the permanent arrest of the cell cycle in response to stress or damage, which contributes to the accumulation of dysfunctional cells in tissues. Recent research has highlighted the role of polyphenols, bioactive compounds present in numerous plant-based foods, in positively modulating these processes. Polyphenols exert antioxidant effects, regulate gene expression and improve mitochondrial function, helping to delay cellular aging and prevent age-related diseases. In addition, some polyphenols exhibit senolytic properties, selectively eliminating senescent cells and promoting tissue regeneration. This review summarizes the current evidence on the effects of polyphenols on aging and cellular senescence, exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms and discussing their potential in nutritional strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging.",
