  "abstract": "Research into drugs that can enhance cardiovascular health has been sparked by the rising prevalence of cardiovascular illnesses (CVDs). In addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities, Resveratrol (RES) is well known for its capacity to increase endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. This page summarises RES's wide effects on energy metabolism, resilience to stress, exercise mimicking, circadian rhythm, lifespan control, and microbiome composition. This article addresses the poor and contradictory results shown in preclinical and clinical trials provides an update on the cardiovascular preventive properties of RES. The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), and natural antioxidant enzymes is associated with some of the positive effects of RES on the cardiovascular system. A microarray data summary indicates a strong correlation between the heart's reaction to calorie restriction and the transcriptional responses to RES. RES has been demonstrated to reduce contractile dysfunction, cardiac remodelling, and hypertrophy in several animal models of heart failure. Its preventive properties are believed to be due to several molecular pathways, including the suppression of prohypertrophic signalling molecules, enhancement of cardiac Ca2+ handling, control of autophagy, and decreases in inflammation. RES thus has the potential to be used in several novel therapeutic approaches for treating diseases such as atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion damage, metabolic syndrome, heart failure, and inflammatory changes associated with ageing.",
