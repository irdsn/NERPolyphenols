  "abstract": "The dense biofilm architecture and efflux pump activity play critical roles in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections by hindering the accumulation and long-term efficacy of antibacterial agents within bacterial cells. The development of engineered nanoparticles capable of penetrating the polysaccharide matrix of biofilms represents a promising strategy for addressing bacterial infections. This is the first report on the synthesis of quercetin-functionalized PEGylated ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs) and the evaluation of their anti-biofilm activity against pathogenic strains of P. aeruginosa. The synthesized NPs exhibited spherical shapes with an average size of 59.52\u00a0nm. ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs demonstrated biofilm inhibitory levels between 49\u00a0% and 67\u00a0%, and significantly reduced the production of total exopolysaccharides, alginate, and pellicle by 64.61\u00a0%-71.69\u00a0%, 30.47\u00a0%-45.36\u00a0%, and 24.22\u00a0%-85.97\u00a0%, respectively. ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs not only inhibited early-stage biofilm formation but also disrupted mature biofilms, indicating a dual mode of action against both biofilm development and persistence. Based on our findings, ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs effectively eradicated mature biofilms by 67.2\u00a0%-72\u00a0% and significantly reduced the metabolic activity and viable cells of preformed biofilms to 34.12\u00a0%-55.57\u00a0% and 6.25-8.15 log CFU, respectively. Electron and fluorescence microscopy analyses also confirmed the antibiofilm potential of ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs. Furthermore, bacterial adhesion and invasion to HDF cells were significantly diminished in the NP-treated groups. The attenuation of efflux pump activity in the NP-treated strains was confirmed using the EtBr-agar cartwheel assay. Taken together, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of ZnO-PEG-QUE NPs as a novel and effective strategy to combat biofilm-associated infections, warranting further investigation in preclinical models.",
