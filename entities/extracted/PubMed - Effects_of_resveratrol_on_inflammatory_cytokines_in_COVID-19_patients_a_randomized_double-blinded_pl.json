  "abstract": "Studies show that the clinical symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are significantly reduced by treatment with medicinal plants, including plants with strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The use of herbal medicines and supplements is considered to be suitable due to relatively mild side effects. Resveratrol is one of the most potent plant compounds found in both medicinal and non-medicinal plants, and it has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Therefore, the aim of the double-blind clinical study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol consumption on biochemical markers, hematological parameters, and some inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19.",
