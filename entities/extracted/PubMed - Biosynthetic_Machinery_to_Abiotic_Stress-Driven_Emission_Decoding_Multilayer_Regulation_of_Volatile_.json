  "abstract": "Volatile terpenoids (VTs) are key secondary metabolites that play dual roles as endogenous antioxidants and airborne signals in plants under abiotic stress. Their biosynthesis is orchestrated via the mevalonate (MVA) and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways, with metabolic plasticity regulated by transcription factors, phytohormonal crosstalk, and stress-responsive elements. Recent advances have revealed that VTs such as isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes help mitigate oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulating antioxidant enzyme systems. However, regulatory mechanisms of stress-induced VT emissions remain fragmented and species-dependent. This review synthesizes current knowledge of VT biosynthesis and emission under abiotic stress, highlights their antioxidant functions and regulatory architecture, and underscores their protective roles in redox homeostasis and stress signal transduction. By identifying key metabolic nodes (e.g., TPS, DXS and MYC2) and stress-responsive pathways, we propose potential molecular targets for the development of stress-resilient cultivars. The integration of VT-based traits into breeding strategies and production-oriented metabolic engineering offers promising avenues for improving crop performance, reducing oxidative damage, and supporting sustainable agricultural systems.",
