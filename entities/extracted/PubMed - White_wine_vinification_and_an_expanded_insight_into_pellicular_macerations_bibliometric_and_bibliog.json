  "title": "White wine vinification and an expanded insight into pellicular macerations: bibliometric and bibliographic review.",
  "abstract": "Pellicular macerations in the vinification of white wines involve the contact of grape skins and seeds with the must before, during or after alcoholic fermentation. Pre-fermentative pellicular maceration aims to enrich the must with volatile compounds and aroma precursors. Fermentative maceration occurs during alcoholic fermentation, whereas post-fermentative maceration is carried out after this process, associated with orange, amber or skin-contact wines, which have experienced a growing global demand in recent years. In this context, this research aimed to conduct a bibliometric review on pellicular macerations in white wines using two search strategies on the specific platform for the period from 2010 to 2023. Additionally, we sought to identify research trends in this segment of the wine industry through a comprehensive literature review of the retrieved documents.",
