  "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and diabetes are a significant public health problem worldwide. Although several novel pharmacological treatments to reduce the progression of CVDs have been discovered during the last 20 years, the better way to contain the onset of CVDs remains prevention. In this regard, nutraceuticals seem to own a great potential in maintaining human health, exerting important protective cardiovascular effects. In the last years, there has been increased focus on identifying natural compounds with cardiovascular health-promoting effects and also to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved. Although many review articles have focused on the individual natural compound impact on cardiovascular diseases, the aim of this manuscript was to examine the role of the most studied nutraceuticals, such as resveratrol, cocoa, quercetin, curcumin, brassica, berberine and Spirulina platensis, on different CVDs.",
