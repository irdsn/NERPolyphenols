The structures of the compounds were identified by spectral analysis and comparison with compounds reported in the literature. The inhibitory activity of all compounds on NO production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was tested. The results showed that compounds 2, 4 and 7 had significant anti-inflammatory activity.",
