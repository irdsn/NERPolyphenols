  "abstract": "A dual-column tandem mode was used to establish the fingerprints ofSarcandraeherb from different origins, and their chemical compositions were characterized by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, which provided an experimental basis for the establishment of a rapid and efficient method for the overall quality control ofSarcandraeherba. For the first time, nine common components were identified from theSarcandraeherba herbs of 24 origins, which were neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, eleutheroside B1, quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucuronide, neoastilbin, astilbin, isofraxidin, and rosmarinic acid, respectively. A total of 92 compounds were identified by liquid mass spectrometry. The quality of theSarcandraeherb from 24 origins was analyzed by similarity evaluation, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis, and the chemical components ofSarcandraeherba were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The results showed that the overall analysis based on fingerprinting and mass spectrometry could differentiate the origins of the herbs.",
