  "abstract": "Considering the complex pathophysiological mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease (AD), a few drugs for managing related cognitive symptoms have been approved. The phytochemical resveratrol has shown promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in AD, but it has low bioavailability. Chemical modification of resveratrol to its glycosylated form, polydatin (PD), significantly increases its bioavailability and bioactivity.",
