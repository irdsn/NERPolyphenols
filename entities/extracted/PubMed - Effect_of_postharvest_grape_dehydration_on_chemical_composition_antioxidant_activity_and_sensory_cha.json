  "abstract": "To explore the effect of postharvest dehydration on grape berries and wine quality, we determined physicochemical properties, polyphenols, antioxidant activities, volatile compounds and sensory characteristics for wines brewed by 'Marselan' (Vitis viniferaL.) grapes with 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% of water loss. The result showed that postharvest dehydration improved the alcohol content, residual sugar and titratable acidity of Marselan wine. Phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities in wines with a dehydration of 20% have significantly increased. Postharvest dehydration increased the contents of isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and ethyl butyrate in Marselan wines, and enhanced the floral, fruity and sweet taste of wines. Marselan wine had the lowest acceptability score under the condition of severe dehydration (25% dehydration), which was related to the significant increase of tannins content. In summary, postharvest dehydration was beneficial in improving the quality of Marselan wine.",
