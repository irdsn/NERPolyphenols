  "abstract": "Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is a critical adverse reaction that restricts the clinical utilization of cisplatin. Alterations in fatty acid metabolism have been associated with the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, yet the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Bavachin, a natural flavonoid, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and lipid metabolism-regulating properties, yet its role in mitigating cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity via mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation remains unexplored.\u00a0Mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a mitochondrial fusion protein, has emerged as a critical regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and lipid homeostasis. However, its role in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity has not been fully explored.",
