  "abstract": "Cancer is a disease marked by the uncontrolled growth and replication of cells. This study investigates the anticancer effects of the phenolic extract fromMangifera indica(MISKPE) seed kernels on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in Swiss albino mice. The findings highlight the therapeutic potential of MISKPE, as it reduced body weight and increased the lifespan of the mice.In vivoantioxidant assays showed significant improvements, including 4.47% SOD, 0.71% LPO and 22.35% catalase activity, alongside enhanced hematological parameters. Phytochemical analysis using 13\u2009C and 1H NMR, as well as GC-MS, identified bioactive compounds like mangiferin, benzene-1, 3, 5-triol and 46-cholestadien-3-beta-ol. Additionally, in silico docking studies suggest that mangiferin, a major component of MISKPE, may possess strong anticancer properties.",
