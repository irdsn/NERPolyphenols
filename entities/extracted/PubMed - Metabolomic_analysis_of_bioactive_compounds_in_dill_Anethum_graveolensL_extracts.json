  "abstract": "Dill (Anethum graveolensL.) is a functional herb known for its dietary, medicinal, and health-promoting agents, as it enriches antioxidants that help to protect cells from oxidative stress and may reduce the risk of several chronic diseases. The daily consumption of active components from dill, achieved through methods such as tea preparation and incorporation into soups and salads, relies on aqueous extraction techniques. The aim of this work was to investigate the metabolic profile of dill leaves extracted with water in various conditions. We also assessed the antioxidant and longevity properties of dill leaf extracts. The availability of aqueous-extracted chemicals from dill promotes therapeutic usage and nutritional supplements, showing its potential as a culinary and medicinal herb.",
