  "abstract": "Propolis (bee glue) is a complex mixture of resins, waxes, and gums, and it is a resinous exudate manufactured by honey bees to maintain the integrity of the hive and defend against external threats. This multifunctional material exhibits several striking properties. The anti-inflammatory properties of propolis have made it a subject of traditional medicine over time, from ancient Egyptian mummification to modern complementary medicine. Propolis with rich phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and flavonoids, exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. This review describes multiple properties and uses of propolis, highlighting the role of propolis as an exceptional natural resource with high therapeutic potential.",
