  "title": "Polyphenols: potent protectors against chronic diseases.",
  "abstract": "Polyphenols, abundant in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, wine, and chocolate, offer significant health benefits. Known for their potent antioxidant properties, they combat oxidative stress by neutralising free radicals, crucial in preventing chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, cardiovascular issues, obesity, and diabetes. Polyphenols also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammation associated with NCDs. Their anticancer activities involve inhibiting cancer cell growth and promoting apoptosis through various pathways. They enhance cardiovascular health by improving endothelial function, lowering blood pressure, and inhibiting atherosclerosis. Additionally, polyphenols improve metabolic health by enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating glucose metabolism, aiding in diabetes and obesity management. These bioactive compounds interact with cellular pathways and gut microbiota, highlighting their multifaceted mechanisms. Integrating polyphenol-rich foods into diets could significantly improve health outcomes and alleviate NCD burdens, advocating for their inclusion in public health strategies and further research to optimise their potential.",
