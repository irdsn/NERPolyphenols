  "abstract": "Ketoglutaric acid (\u03b1-KGA) is a dicarboxylic ketoacid with strong biological activity, whose main role in eukaryotic organisms is to participate in the Krebs cycle. In the present study, we tested whether the application of \u03b1-KGA to edible sprout culture would increase the content of low-molecular-weight antioxidants by improving their mitochondrial activity. For this purpose, broccoli sprouts were treated at the beginning of germination with an aqueous solution of \u03b1-KGA, at various concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, and 10\u2009mmol\u2009L-1), which after 5\u2009days of germination were analyzed for markers of antioxidant status, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism.",
