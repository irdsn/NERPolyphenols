  "title": "Nacre-like structural carboxymethyl cellulose dual-layered film with a combination of high strength, elongation, and UV-blocking for food packaging.",
  "abstract": "Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) holds great potential for food preservation applications, provided its mechanical properties and UV-blocking performance are significantly enhanced. Considering this, the study focuses on developing a novel dual-layered film using the layer-by-layer casting method. The resulting film exhibits a compact dual-layered structure, with a nacre-like upper layer (chitosan/montmorillonite/tea polyphenols) and a dense bottom layer (CMC/sodium alginate/nano-hydroxyapatite/tea polyphenols). This design enhances tensile strength through hydrogen bonding interactions among nanoparticles, active substances, and polymers, while the nacre-like and layered structures contribute to improve elongation. Furthermore, the incorporation of tea polyphenols significantly enhances the UV-blocking performance of the film. Compared to the single-layer film, the dual-layered film exhibits improved tensile strength (from 45.19\u00a0MPa to 63.58\u00a0MPa), elongation (from 52.56\u00a0% to 82.45\u00a0%), and UV-blocking capability (from 99\u00a0% to 100\u00a0%). Additionally, the dual-layered film presents excellent water resistance (moisture content: 13.64\u00a0%, water solubility: 6.26\u00a0%), oxygen permeability (1.841\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3g/m2s) and antioxidant activity (scavenging capability for DPPH: 67.25\u00a0%). When employed as packaging film, the dual-layered film effectively reduces tomatoes weight loss from 9.04\u00a0% to 7.52\u00a0% and extends shelf life. This study offers an innovative approach to promote the development of CMC for food preservation applications.",
