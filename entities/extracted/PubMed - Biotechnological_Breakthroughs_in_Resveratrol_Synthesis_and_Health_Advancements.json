  "abstract": "This academic review examines the latest biotechnology methods for resveratrol synthesis. We aim to study the health advantages of resveratrol consumption beyond synthesis and demonstrate its potential as a therapeutic agent. An extensive examination of the current state of literature was performed, employing a diverse range of scholarly databases with the purpose of collating pertinent information and conducting in-depth research on the subject matter. The main goal was to find and assess research on resveratrol's health effects and the latest biotechnology methods for synthesizing it. This review paper discusses resveratrol synthesis methods, including their efficacy and current advances. The findings highlight the significant potential of biotechnological methods in improving both the synthesis of resveratrol and its beneficial effects on health. Our comprehensive analysis substantiates the importance of biotechnological methodologies in synthesizing resveratrol. The literature review highlights resveratrol's therapeutic properties, which have been scientifically approved for the prevention and treatment of various ailments, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic illnesses, cancer, aging, and immunomodulation.",
