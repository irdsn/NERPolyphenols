  "abstract": "Systemic inflammatory responses and oxidative stress occur in laying hens during the aging process, particularly during the post-peaking laying period, which generally result in multi-organ damages, leading to significant declines in egg performance and quality. Chlorogenic acid (CGA)-enriched extract from Eucommia ulmoides leaves has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, the mechanisms underlying whether and how CGA alleviates systemic inflammatory responses and oxidative stress to improve egg performance and quality in post-peaking laying hens remain unclear. In this study, the potential regulatory mechanisms of CGA in alleviating inflammatory responses and oxidative stress along the gut-liver axis were investigated. A total of 360 55-week-old Hy-line white-laying hens were randomly selected and divided into four groups. The hens in the four groups were fed a basal diet (CON) or basal diets supplemented with 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg of CGA (CGA200, CGA400, and CGA800, respectively) for 10 weeks.",
