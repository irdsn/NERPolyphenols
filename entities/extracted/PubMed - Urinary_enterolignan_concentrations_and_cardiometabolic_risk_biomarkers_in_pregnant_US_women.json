  "abstract": "Prior evidence suggests that dietary lignans may mitigate inflammation, attenuate insulin resistance, and improve blood lipids. Little is known about the effects of lignans in pregnant women who are at elevated risk of glucose and lipid abnormalities, partially due to increase in estrogen levels during pregnancy. This study was designed to investigate the association between dietary lignan intake, measured as urinary enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone), with blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic risks in pregnant women.",
