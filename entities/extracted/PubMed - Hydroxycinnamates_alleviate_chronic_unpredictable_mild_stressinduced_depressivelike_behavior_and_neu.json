  "abstract": "The polyphenolic compounds ferulic acid (FA) and p\u2011coumaric acid (PCA) have been extensively studied for their free radical scavenging and anti\u2011inflammatory properties. Both compounds are present in food and beverages commonly consumed globally. Our molecular modeling, in\u2011vitro, and in\u2011vivo studies suggest that the compounds may be neuroprotective by modulating the nucleotide\u2011binding domain, leucine\u2011rich\u2011containing family, pyrin domain\u2011containing\u20113 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway. The current study explored the dose\u2011dependent neuroprotective potential of FA and PCA in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model. Male Swiss albino mice were divided into nine groups consisting of control (CON), CUMS, FA10 (10 mg/kg FA), FA40 (40 mg/kg FA), FA160 (160 mg/kg FA), PCA10 (10 mg/kg PCA), PCA40 (40 mg/kg PCA), PCA160 (160 mg/kg PCA), and FLX (10 mg/kg fluoxetine). All animals, except the CON group, received random mild stressors for 21 days, and from day 22\u201142, the treatments were administered alongside the stressors. Behavioral assessments were performed on day 42, followed by sample collection. Brain homogenates from CUMS\u2011exposed animals expressed elevated levels of the pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2, IL\u20116 and tumor necrosis factor\u2011alpha (TNF\u2011\u03b1), and oxidative stress markers. Treatment with FA and PCA effectively reduced cytokine release and oxidative stress, alleviating the depressive\u2011like behavior.",
