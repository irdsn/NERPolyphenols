  "abstract": "After rhabdomyolysis, muscle tissue releases substances such as myoglobin, creatine kinase, and electrolytes into the bloodstream, potentially leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and it is found in various plants. This research evaluated the protective effects of RSV in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI in rat kidneys.",
