  "abstract": "This study explored the extraction of genistein-7-O-[\u03b1-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21926)]-\u03b2-glucopyranoside (GTG) fromDerris scandensusing an aqueous-ethanol solvent system, aiming to optimize yield and antioxidant activity. Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) were employed to determine the optimal solvent composition, with the highest GTG yield (6.83 \u00b1 0.06 mg/g dried weight) obtained from 50% ethanol-correlating well with HSP predictions. Ultrasonic extraction was most effective with solvents having a dielectric constant between 50 and 60. The antioxidant potential of isolated GTG was evaluated using the DPPH assay, which yielded an IC50of 87.86 \u00b1 1.85 \u03bcM, and the FRAP assay, with a value of 34.23 \u00b1 2.75 mg FeSO4equivalents. Molecular orbital analysis revealed HOMO and LUMO energy gaps (\u0394E = 10.6715 eV) similar to known antioxidants such as gallic acid, ascorbic acid, Trolox, and quercetin. These findings demonstrate that HSP effectively guided solvent selection for ultrasound-assisted extraction of GTG. The antioxidant activity is attributed to GTG's capacity to donate electrons and stabilize radicals via extended charge delocalization within the aglycone structure, confirming its potential as a natural antioxidant agent.",
