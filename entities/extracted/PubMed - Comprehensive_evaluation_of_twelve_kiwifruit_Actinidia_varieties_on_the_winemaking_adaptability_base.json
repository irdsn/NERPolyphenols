  "abstract": "As one of the deep processing products of kiwifruit, kiwifruit wine (KW) has shown good commercial development prospects. In this paper, the wine-making adaptability and quality characteristics of 12 kiwifruit varieties with three pulp colors were systematically evaluated from the aspects of basic physicochemical, functional and sensory qualities. The results of the study showed that the ratio of sugar to acid of Hongyang wine was 0.81, which was significantly higher than other varieties. In terms of functional quality, the vitamin C content of Puyu wine was 214.43\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, which was significantly higher than that of other varieties. Hongshi No.2 wine is the variety with the highest content of total polyphenols and flavonoid, the contents are 51.64\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g and 18.86\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the wines in descending order was red-fleshed, yellow-fleshed and green-fleshed. The results of the color characterization showed that the brightness of all the wines was higher than 80, indicating that the KW were relatively clear and transparent. The result of artificial sensory evaluation showed that the Hongshi No.2 wine was more popular overall. Based on principal component analysis, optimal solution based ranking approach and gray relevance analysis models, Hongshi No.2 wine ranks first overall due to its rich nutritional content, sweet taste, and rich fruity aroma. This study involves the kiwifruit varieties with the largest planting area in the world, and the quality characteristics of their corresponding KW varieties were preliminary analyzed and compared. It provides a theoretical basis with strong pertinence and wide coverage for the production of various KW types, so as to contribute to the sustainable development of KW industry.",
