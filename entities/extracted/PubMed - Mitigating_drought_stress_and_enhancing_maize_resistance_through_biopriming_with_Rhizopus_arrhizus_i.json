  "abstract": "Drought stress represents a significant threat to crop productivity, particularly in regions characterized by water scarcity. This study investigated the potential of utilizing endophytic fungi to enhance drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays L.). Specifically, we aimed to investigate the role of these fungi in improving the physiological, morphological, and molecular responses of maize plants subjected to drought conditions.",
