  "abstract": "The therapeutic application of flavonoids in the management of infectious diseases, cancers, chronic wounds, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders has been well documented in scientific literature. The citric flavonoid naringenin comes under the category of flavanone and exhibits a plethora of health benefits. Very few flavonoids such as curcumin, resveratrol, catechin, quercetin, and kaempferol have been studied to exert their anti-aging properties in humans. The effect of naringenin in the context of age-associated disorders in detail has not been elucidated yet. The databases used for the literature search were Science Direct, Google Scholar, and PubMed. More emphasis has been put on the recent literature on \"naringenin\" and its effect on \"age-associated disorders.\" Almost all chronic degenerative disorders are characterized by oxidative stress and inflammatory response. The study aims at highlighting the reactive oxygen species-mediated activity of naringenin and the underlying molecular mechanism leading to the prevention of various age-associated disorders. Altogether, the review presents a systematic comprehension of the pharmaceutical and clinicopathological benefits of naringenin in age-associated disorders.",
