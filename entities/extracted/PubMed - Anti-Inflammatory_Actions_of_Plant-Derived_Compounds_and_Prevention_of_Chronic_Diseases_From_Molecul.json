  "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a key contributor to the development and progression of numerous chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and obesity. As the side effects of conventional anti-inflammatory drugs pose challenges, plant-derived compounds have emerged as promising alternatives due to their potent anti-inflammatory properties and minimal adverse effects. This review explores the molecular mechanisms by which these compounds alleviate chronic inflammation and highlights their potential role in disease prevention. Polyphenols (e.g., quercetin and resveratrol), flavonoids (e.g., luteolin and apigenin), carotenoids (e.g., \u03b2-carotene and lycopene), and other phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin and gingerol) modulate inflammatory pathways, such as nuclear factor-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Plant-derived compounds interact with the gut microbiota, enhancing anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence from animal studies and clinical trials has demonstrated their efficacy in reducing inflammation-related biomarkers and improving health outcomes. However, challenges such as low bioavailability and determination of the optimal dosage require further investigation. Advancing delivery technologies and personalized nutrition strategies may help overcome these barriers. This review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of plant-derived compounds in preventing chronic diseases and underscores the need for continued research to translate these findings into practical applications for public health.",
