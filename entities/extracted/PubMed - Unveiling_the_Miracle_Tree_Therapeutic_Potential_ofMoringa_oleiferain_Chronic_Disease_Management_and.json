  "abstract": "Moringa oleifera(MO) has gained recognition as a potent natural intervention for preventing and managing chronic diseases (CDs) due to its diverse phytochemical composition and pharmacological properties. Rich in antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, and glucosinolates, MO exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, cardioprotective, and anti-obesity effects. These properties make it a valuable therapeutic agent for CDs, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. MO's ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation-key drivers of CDs-highlights its significant role in disease prevention and treatment. MO enhances insulin sensitivity, regulates lipid profiles and blood pressure, reduces inflammation, and protects against oxidative damage. MO also modulates key signaling pathways involved in cancer and liver disease prevention. Studies suggest that MO extracts possess anticancer activity by modulating apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, and interacting with key signaling pathways, including YAP/TAZ, Nrf2-Keap1, TLR4/NF-\u03baB, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin. However, challenges such as variability in bioactive compounds, taste acceptability, and inconsistent clinical outcomes limit their widespread application. While preclinical studies support its efficacy, large-scale clinical trials, standardized formulations, and advanced delivery methods are needed to optimize its therapeutic potential. MO's multifunctional applications make it a promising and sustainable solution for combating chronic diseases, especially in resource-limited settings.",
