  "abstract": "Sarcopenia or frailty is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The protein-bound uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) is associated with frailty. IS induces apoptosis and disruption of mitochondrial activity in skeletal muscle. However, the association of IS with anabolic myokines such as irisin in patients with CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear. This study aims to elucidate whether IS induces frailty by dysregulating irisin in patients with CKD.",
