  "abstract": "Microencapsulation is considered to be an effective means to overcome the defects of Sichuan pepper oleoresin (SPO) and to enhance applications. To explore the improvement effect of microencapsulation on SPO in practical applications, the typical activities and flavor stability under different processing and storage conditions of SPO before and after embedding by sodium octenyl succinate starch-tea polyphenols complexes were investigated based on our previous study. The results indicated that microencapsulation improved the stability and water solubility of SPO, causing the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities to increase by 51.39 and 21.16 times. Although the flavor of SPO was highly unstable, encapsulation resisted the flavor deterioration of SPO during processing and storage, which was fundamentally attributed to the fact that coating and antioxidant effect of wall material reduced the dispersion of SPO and controlled its peroxide value to 59.59-89.23\u00a0meq/kg. This has important implications for improving the processing quality of flavored foods.",
