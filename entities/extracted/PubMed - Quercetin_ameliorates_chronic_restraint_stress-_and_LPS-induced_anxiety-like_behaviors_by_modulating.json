  "abstract": "Quercetin is a natural flavonoid which has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties. Neuroinflammation has recently been identified as a major cause of anxiety disorders. Both the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are important brain regions that regulate anxiety. This study aims to explore the effect of quercetin on anxiety-like behaviors, as well as the underlying mechanisms associated with neuroinflammation in the LH and BNST.",
