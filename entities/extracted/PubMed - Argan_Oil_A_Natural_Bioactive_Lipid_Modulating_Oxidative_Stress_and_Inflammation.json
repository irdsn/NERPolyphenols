  "title": "Argan Oil: A Natural Bioactive Lipid Modulating Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.",
  "abstract": "Nutrition is a key determinant in modulating disease risk, with numerous studies highlighting the role of antioxidants and lipids, particularly the micronutrient and fatty acid composition of natural oils and their bioactive metabolites. In this context, argan oil-a vegetable oil extracted from the kernels ofArgania spinosa-has gained significant attention due to its well-balanced fatty acid profile, rich in oleic and linoleic acids, and its high levels of antioxidant compounds, including tocopherols, polyphenols, and phytosterols, particularly schottenol and spinasterol. Thanks to its unique composition, argan oil exhibits protective properties against harmful biological processes, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which play a significant role in various diseases. Preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have demonstrated that argan oil reduces oxidative stress by preventing DNA damage, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation, while simultaneously increasing antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, it modulates inflammatory responses by decreasing pro-inflammatory biomarkers, increasing anti-inflammatory markers, and limiting immune cell infiltration across different tissues. These antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects are thought to be linked to argan oil's ability to regulate key signaling pathways, such as Nrf-2 and NF-\u03baB. Although direct evidence remains limited, studies suggest that its main bioactive components-fatty acid, \u03b3-tocopherol, ferulic acid, and campesterol-can influence these pathways, either by activating Nrf2 to boost antioxidant defenses or by inhibiting NF-\u03baB to suppress inflammation. This review explores the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of argan oil, drawing insights from a range of scientific studies to better understand its therapeutic potential.",
