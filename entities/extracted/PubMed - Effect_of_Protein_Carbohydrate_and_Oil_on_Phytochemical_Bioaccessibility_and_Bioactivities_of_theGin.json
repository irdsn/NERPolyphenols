  "abstract": "The present work evaluates the effect of casein, glucose, and olive oil on phytochemical bioaccessibility, antioxidant potential (DPPH and FRAP), antidiabetic potential (inhibition of amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, and BSA glycation), and antihyperlipidemic potential (inhibition of lipase) of gingko standardized leaf extract in the form of tablets after in vitro digestion. Gingko extract formulations with protein, carbohydrates, and oil had high (>70%) in vitro bioaccessibility of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin after each phases of digestion in comparison to moderate (35-70%) in vitro bioaccessibility from gingko water extract. Formulation with the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of the majority of the tested polyphenolic groups and terpene lactones after oral and intestinal phases was ginkgo with olive oil. High (>70%) antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP), antidiabetic (\u03b1-glucosidase and BSA glycation), and antihyperlipidemic potential were detected in almost all ginkgo formulations. Based on the results, we conclude that the in vitro bioaccessibility of individual compounds or groups of compounds depends on whether the tablets are taken with water or with foods (protein, carbohydrates, and oil).",
