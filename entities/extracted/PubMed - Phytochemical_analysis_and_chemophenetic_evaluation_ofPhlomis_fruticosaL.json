  "abstract": "In this work, the first complete phytochemical analysis ever performed on a European population ofPhlomis fruticosaL., led to the identification of twelve metabolites from its leaf ethanolic extract: pheophytina(1), verbascoside (2), leucosceptoside A (3), apigenin (4), kaempferol (5), 5-hydroxy-8-epi-loganin (6), lamiide (7), penstemoside (8), 5-deoxy-pulchelloside I (9), quinic acid (10), vanillic acid (11) and glycerol (12). Their chemophenetic value was evaluated individuating and even suggesting chemophenetic markers at various levels.",
