  "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate in humans. In acute infection, an abnormal immune response results in excessive inflammatory cytokines and uncontrolled systemic inflammation that can result in organ damage and multi-organ failure. While vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies are available, there is an urgent need for effective small-molecule antivirals against EBOV. Here, we report on the optimization of tamoxifen, an EBOV-glycoprotein (GP) binder that inhibits viral entry, using our Sulfur-Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry-based high-throughput medicinal chemistry (HTMC) strategy. Using a \"Direct-to-Biology\" approach, we generated a focused library of 2,496 tamoxifen analogs overnight and screened them in a cell-based pseudo-EBOV infection assay. The HTMC workflow enabled the development of a potent EBOV entry inhibitor with submicromolar EC50cellular antiviral activity and more than 50-fold improvement in binding affinity against EBOV-GP compared to the parent compound. Our findings underscore the use of SuFEx-enabled HTMC for rapidly generating and assessing potential therapeutic candidates against viral and immune-mediated diseases in a cell-based assay.",
