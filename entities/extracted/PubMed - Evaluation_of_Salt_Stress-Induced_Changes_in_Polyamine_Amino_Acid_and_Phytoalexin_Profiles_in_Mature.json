  "abstract": "Salinity stress has become an increasing threat to viticulture in the Tunisian oasis, and more generally, the characterization of salinity tolerance markers can be of great interest for sustainable grape production. This study investigated some metabolic adaptations in different tissues of the ripe berries of indigenous grapevine cultivars after exposure to salt stress to identify the key traits of salt stress tolerance under oasis conditions. We especially focused on the adaptive responses occurring at the level of amino acids, polyamines, and stilbene phytoalexins in the grape berry skin, pulp, and seeds of six grapevine cultivars differing in phenotypic and ampelographic characteristics. Our data showed that amino acids accumulated strongly in the pulp and skin, while resveratrol, trans-piceid and trans-\u03b5-viniferin, as major phytoalexins, significantly accumulated in the seeds. High salinity was also found to increase both the berry skin and pulp contents of essential amino acids such as threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, and phenylalanine. The amounts of stilbenes also increased under high salinity in the berry skin of all the studied cultivars. Polyamine homeostasis within the different berry tissues suggested enhanced polyamine biosynthesis rather than polyamine oxidation in response to high salinity. Our principal component analysis revealed a clear discrimination between the cultivars based on their metabolic profiles within the ripe berry tissues under high salinity.",
