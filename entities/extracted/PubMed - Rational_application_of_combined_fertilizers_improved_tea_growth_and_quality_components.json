  "abstract": "The excessive and sole use of chemical fertilizers has been found to deteriorate tea quality components. Therefore, to explore the effects of rational application of combined organic and chemical fertilizers on tea growth and quality, a pot experiment was conducted with six treatments of rational and combined organic fertilizer (OF) and chemical fertilizer (CF) which were as follows: control (no fertilizer was applied), 0OF/CF100 (only CF was applied), 25OF/75CF (25% OF + 75% CF), 50CF/50OF (50% OF + 50% CF), 75OF/25CF (75% OF + 25% CF), and 100OF/0CF (only OF was applied). The biomass of tea plant, net photosynthetic rate, chloroplast ultrastructure, and tea quality components including tea polyphenols (TPs), flavonoids, sugars, catechins, caffeine, total amino acids (TAAs), chlorophyll pigments and TP/TAA were measured.",
