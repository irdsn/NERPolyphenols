  "abstract": "Patients with obesity-associated Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) have been prevalent in clinical practice. Obesity is a risk factor for HT as it promotes pro-inflammatory processes and influences the balance of immune cell subsets. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is characterized by its multi-component and multi-target approach and shows potential in treating HT. Specifically, TCM can reduce thyroid antibody levels and alleviate clinical symptoms without impairing thyroid function. Moreover, TCM offers significant benefits in regulating lipid metabolism and decreasing systemic inflammation.",
