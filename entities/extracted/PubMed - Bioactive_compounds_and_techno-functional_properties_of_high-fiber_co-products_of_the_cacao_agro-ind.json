  "abstract": "The cacao shell (CS) and cacao pod husk (CPH), two of the most promising high-fiber co-products of the cacao agro-industrial chain, were evaluated to determine their potential incorporation into food products. This research determined bioactive compounds and techno-functional properties of CS and CPH, and was evaluated the enzymatic inactivation by thermal treatments in CPH. We found that CS is rich in protein, lipids, dietary fiber (48.1 \u00b1 0.3 g 100 gdw-1), and antioxidant molecules such as epicatechin (1.10 \u00b1 0.02 mg g-1) and isoquercetin (1.04 \u00b1 0.09 mg g-1). Moreover, in CS a positive effect of hydration mechanism occur; in fact, it was observed a reduction of Lightness (L\u2217) value and a remarkable color difference (\u0394E\u2217,18.8 \u00b1 0.7) (CIEL\u2217a\u2217b\u2217 color space), between hydrated and dry CS samples; so, it could be used as a potential natural colorant in foods. CPH resulted equally rich in dietary fiber (35.3-37.4%) and flavonoids (2.9 \u00b1 0.1 mg RE g-1); in this co-product, the rapid enzymatic inactivation by thermal treatments was essential to obtain the highest antioxidant activity and polyphenols content; regarding the techno-functional properties, it was found that CPH flour had high hydration capacity, so CPH can use it as a replacement for emulsifiers or water holding additives while incorporating the fiber and abundantly found antioxidants.",
