  "abstract": "The astringency of natural polyphenols affects consumers' acceptance for food, and it is urgent to find safe and effective astringency-masking substances. This study introduced \u03b9-carrageenan (CA) as a novel astringency-masking agent and investigated its interaction mechanism using epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and \u03b2-casein (\u03b2CN) as model compounds. Sensory evaluation demonstrated that 0.3\u00a0% CA achieved a 56-80\u00a0% reduction in astringency intensity scores for four polyphenols, with masking efficacy exhibiting concentration-dependent enhancement. Through integrated analytical approaches including techniques such as multispectral analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry, we revealed concentration-dependent interference patterns in EGCG-\u03b2CN interactions. Three distinct mechanisms were elucidated: (1) Competitive binding with \u03b2CN to inhibit EGCG-induced protein precipitation; (2) Facilitation of \u03b2CN aggregation into higher molecular weight coacervates; (3) Formation of ternary EGCG-CA-\u03b2CN complexes. These findings highlight the potential of CA in the development of low astringency functional foods, providing the food industry with a new strategy for masking astringency.",
