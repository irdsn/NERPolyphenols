  "abstract": "Chemical analysis of the hydroethanolicHypericum repensL. extracts was performed using the LC/Q-T\u03bfF/HRMS technique. The majority of compounds identified belonged to phenolics, particularly flavonoids. The extract was also studied for its possible bioactivities, demonstrating high antioxidant properties compared to the control (IC50values ranging from 4.6 to 9.42 \u03bcg/mL). Significant antibacterial activity was also detected againstEscherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus,Enterococcus faecalis,andSalmonella enteritidis,with MIC values from 125 to 625 \u03bcg/mL.S. aureuspresented the highest susceptibility among all bacteria tested. Additionally, the extract showed very mild anticholinesterase activity in the AChE and BChE inhibition assays. These findings provide the first insights into the phytochemical composition, as well as the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticholinesterase activities ofH. repensextract, suggesting that the endemic CyprusH. repensis a valuable natural rich source of bioactive compounds with a potentially broad range of bioactivities.",
