  "abstract": "Coenzyme Q10 is an essential lipid in the mitochondrial electron transport system and an important antioxidant. It declines with age and in various diseases, there is a need for a method to compensate for the decrease in coenzyme Q10. Resveratrol, a well-known anti-aging compound, has been shown to undergo metabolism to coenzyme Q10's benzene ring moiety in cells. However, administration of resveratrol did not alter or only slightly increased total intracellular coenzyme Q10 levels in many cell types. Synthesis of coenzyme Q10 requires not only the benzene ring moiety but also the side chain moiety. Biosynthesis of the side chain portion of coenzyme Q10 is mediated by the mevalonic acid pathway. Here, we explore the impact of resveratrol on coenzyme Q10 levels in HepG2 cells, which possess a robust mevalonic acid pathway. As a results, intracellular coenzyme Q10 levels were increased by resveratrol administration. Analysis using13C6-resveratrol revealed that the benzene ring portion of resveratrol was converted to coenzyme Q10. Inhibition of the mevalonic acid pathway prevented the increase in coenzyme Q10 levels induced by resveratrol administration. These results indicate that resveratrol may be beneficial as a coenzyme Q10-enhancing reagent in cells with a well-developed mevalonic acid pathway.",
