  "abstract": "This study examined the effects of convective drying parameters, including temperature (40, 50, and 60\u00a0\u00b0C) and tray loading density (0.057 and 0.113\u00a0g/cm2), on the bioactive compounds, antioxidant properties, and structural characteristics of radish sango microgreens powder. Drying at 50\u00a0\u00b0C with 0.057\u00a0g/cm2preserved the highest anthocyanins (43.23\u00a0\u03bcmol/100\u00a0g), phenolics (189.45\u00a0mg GAE/100\u00a0g), and antioxidant activities (DPPH 43.13\u00a0%, and FRAP 10.80\u00a0\u03bcmol TE/g), while drying at 50\u00a0\u00b0C with 0.113\u00a0g/cm2preserved the highest flavonoids (5.86\u00a0mg QUE/100\u00a0g) and ascorbic acid (239.18\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g) of radish sango microgreens. Degradation kinetics followed a first-order model, with thermal sensitivity varying among compounds. FTIR analysis revealed functional groups linked to bioactive compounds, while SEM showed flake-like particles enhancing solvent interaction. These findings highlight the significance of controlled drying in retaining functional and structural qualities, supporting the potential of radish sango microgreens in functional food and pharmaceuticals applications.",
