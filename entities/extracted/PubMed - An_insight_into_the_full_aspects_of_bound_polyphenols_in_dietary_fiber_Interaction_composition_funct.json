  "abstract": "Dietary fiber (DF) and polyphenols are both bioactive compounds with various health-promoting effects while close relationship between them aroused wide concern in recent years. Abundant polyphenols combine with DF and contribute greatly to its beneficial effects. Although efforts made to uncover such bound polyphenols (BPs) from different angles before, systematic overview of full aspects is deficient. Here, more details about polyphenols conjugated in DF reported recently were summarized systematically. Meanwhile, the disposition of BPs in gastrointestinal tract and their interaction with microbiome were introduced to clarify the foundation of their functions. Moreover, considering the great impacts of food processing on polyphenols, different technics used in food handling were introduced with their effects on BPs emphatically discussed to provide guideline for reasonable application of specific technics for given materials. Our work is supposed to promote the understanding of BPs in DF and facilitate their future exploitation and application as a whole.",
