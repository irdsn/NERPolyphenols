  "abstract": "Botrytis cinereahas become an enormous threat to crop production worldwide. In order to discover novel antifungal molecules with high control efficacy againstBotrytis cinerea, a series of cyclohexyl sulfonamide derivatives containing stilbene fragments were designed and synthesized using chesulfamide as a lead compound. Bioassay results indicated that these novel compounds have moderate to excellentin vivoantifungal activity. CompoundsII-9,II-11, andII-15have outstanding control efficacy on strawberries (97.0%, 92.8%, 91.6%) at 400 \u03bcg/mL, surpassing that of control agents boscalid and procymidone (51.4%, 85.0%). CompoundsII-15,II-25,II-27, andII-30have similar activity (up to 90.9%) on tomato pots at 200 \u03bcg/mL as control agents boscalid (85.4%). The preliminary mode of action of compoundII-15was discussed by scanning electron microscope observation, permeability measurement, and a propidium iodide staining experiment. Transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate the influence of compoundII-15on gene expression. Additionally, DFT calculation was used to analyze the molecular orbitals and electrostatic potential distribution of compoundII-15. This work indicates that compoundII-15can be considered a promising candidate for novel fungicides againstBotrytis cinerea.",
