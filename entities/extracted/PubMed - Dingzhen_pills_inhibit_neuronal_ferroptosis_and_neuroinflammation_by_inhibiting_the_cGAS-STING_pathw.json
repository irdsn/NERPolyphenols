  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease whose cause and molecular mechanism remain unclear. Dingzhen pill (DZP), a water extract from crude herbs, is thought to possibly play a neuroprotective role in PD. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of the DZP and its impact on the potential pathways against PD have not been elucidated.",
