  "abstract": "Procyanidins have strong potential for antioxidation and decreasing hepatic fat accumulation thus preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Procyanidin A2 (PCA2), predominately found in cranberries, avocado, peanut red skins and litchi fruit pericarp, is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. However, literatures about its metabolic profile by gut microbiota and effects on lipid metabolism are limited. Therefore, the metabolites of PCA2 by human intestinal microbiota as well as their antioxidant and hypolipidemic potential were investigated.",
