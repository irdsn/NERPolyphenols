  "title": "Grape Pomace Polyphenols Reduce Acute Inflammatory Response Induced by Carrageenan in a Murine Model.",
  "abstract": "Grape pomace (GP), a by-product of wine production, contains bioactive polyphenols with potential health benefits. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory properties of a polyphenolic fraction derived from GP, obtained by ultrasound-microwave hybrid extraction and purified using ion-exchange chromatography. In the inflammation model, mice were divided into six groups: intact, carrageenan, indomethacin, and three GP polyphenols treatment groups. Paw edema was induced by subplantar injection of carrageenan, and the GP polyphenols were administered intraperitoneally at doses of 10, 20, and 40\u2005mg/kg. The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by measuring paw volume, and expression of inflammatory markers: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), along with lipid peroxidation levels. The GP polyphenols significantly reduced paw edema and expression levels of COX-2, MPO, and cytokines in a dose-dependent manner effect, with the highest dose showing the greatest reduction. Additionally, lipid peroxidation levels were also decreased by GP polyphenols treatment at doses of 10 and 20\u2005mg/kg. These findings suggest that ultrasound-microwave extraction combined with amberlite purification proved to be effective in obtaining a polyphenolic-rich fraction from GP. Thus, GP polyphenols may serve as a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent for treating inflammation and oxidative stress-related diseases.",
