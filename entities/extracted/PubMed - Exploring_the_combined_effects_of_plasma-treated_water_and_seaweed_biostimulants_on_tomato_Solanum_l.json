  "abstract": "This study investigates the combine effects of seaweed biostimulants (Swb) and nonthermal plasma (NTP)-treated water on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of tomato seedlings along with phenolic compound levels under sorbitol-mediated drought stress. Plasma-treated seaweed biostimulants (PTSwb) showed a considerable increase in seed germination, with 86\u00a0% on day 2 and 100\u00a0% on day 4, whereas the control (46\u00a0% and 66\u00a0%) and Swb alone (53\u00a0% and 73\u00a0%) exhibited reduced effects. PTSwb elevated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) along with chlorophyll, carotenoids and protein content. Ascorbate reduced to 7.9\u00a0\u03bcM, effectively detoxifying elevated H2O2levels. Ascorbate peroxidase increased to 34.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mg, whereas glutathione peroxidase decreased to 6.74\u00a0\u03bcg/mg in PTSwb. Moreover, anthocyanin level increased 70\u00a0%, indicating phenolic compounds stimulated. This study underscores that combination treatment is essential for developing novel mechanisms between biochemical and physiological traits in tomatoes.",
