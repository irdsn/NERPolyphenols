  "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation, a defining feature of obesity, disrupts essential signalling pathways involved in nutrient sensing and mitochondria homeostasis. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) serves as a pivotal regulator of the cellular stress response, and recent studies have implicated it in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric, has been identified as a potent activator of NRF-2. Evidence suggests curcumin impacts obesity and metabolic disorders by modulating gut microbiota composition, increasing energy expenditure, and regulating lipid metabolism. Orlistat, an anti-obesity drug, inhibits fat absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, but its side effects limits its broader use.",
