  "abstract": "The present study was conducted to optimize fermentation conditions for preparation ofChaenomeles sinensisGlutinous Rice Wine (CRW). The dynamic changes of main substances in the liquor during fermentation process, aroma components, biologically active substances and antioxidant capacity in the CRW after 6\u00a0months of aging were tested. The results showed that under optimized conditions, the yield and alcohol content of wine was 44.97 and 20.00%, respectively. After aging, 64 aroma components were detected in the wine, mainly alcohols and esters. The alcohol content of the CRW was 14.8%. Polyphenols and flavonoids reached 0.23\u00a0g/L and 0.037\u00a0g/L respectively. Furthermore, the CRW had an excellent free radical scavenging ability.",
