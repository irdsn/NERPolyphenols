  "abstract": "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a stress-induced hepatokine with emerging roles in liver injury. Estrogen-related receptor \u03b3 (ERR\u03b3), a nuclear receptor regulating mitochondrial function and metabolic stress, has also been implicated in various liver injury conditions. However, the regulatory interplay between ERR\u03b3 and GDF15 remains unclear. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying GDF15 expression and secretion in the liver, focusing on the role of ERR\u03b3 during acute and chronic liver injury.",
