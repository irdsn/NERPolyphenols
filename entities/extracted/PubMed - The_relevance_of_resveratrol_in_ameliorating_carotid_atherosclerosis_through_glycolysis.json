  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) poses a pressing challenge in contemporary medicine. Glycolysis is a crucial bioenergetic metabolic pathway that provides the primary energy source for endothelial cells. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural compound that has been shown to possess AS. However, the underlying mechanisms of its anti-atherosclerotic effects are not yet fully understood.",
