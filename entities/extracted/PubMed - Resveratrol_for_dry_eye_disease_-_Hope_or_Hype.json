  "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial and common ophthalmic disease that has a tremendous effect on the quality of life. It is now becoming a public health concern because of our changing lifestyle and environment. The current treatment modalities, artificial tear substitutes, and anti-inflammatory therapy are directed at dry eye symptoms. One of the major drivers for DED is oxidative stress, and the polyphenol group of natural compounds has the potential to reduce the same. Resveratrol, widely found in the skin of grapes and nuts, has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. It has been shown to have beneficial effects in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, uveitis, and diabetic retinopathy. Studies have also explored the beneficial effects of resveratrol in DED, making it as a promising therapeutic molecule. Resveratrol has not yet reached clinical application because of difficulty in deliverability and low bioavailability. In this review, we explore the potential of resveratrol in DED treatment based on various in vitro and in vivo studies.",
