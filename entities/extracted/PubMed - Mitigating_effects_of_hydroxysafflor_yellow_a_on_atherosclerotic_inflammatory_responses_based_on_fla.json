  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is an important cardiovascular disease caused by inflammation. The inhibitory effect of HysA on the Piezo1-YAP/JNK signaling pathway in a mouse model of AS was studied to clarify its anti-inflammatory effects. The study evaluated HysA's ability to bind Piezo1 through molecular docking analysis. C57BL/6 mice were used to establish AS model, and cell treatment and animal experiments were carried out. Inflammatory markers and lipid accumulation were evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Westernblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and oil red O staining techniques. Weight changes in mice were recorded to monitor disease progression. The molecular docking results show that HysA has a good binding affinity with Piezo1. In a mouse model of AS, treatment with HysA significantly reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the activation of YAP and JNK signaling pathways. The HysA treatment group showed lower oil red O staining levels, indicating that it effectively mitigated lipid deposition. Therefore, HysA significantly alleviates the inflammatory response of atherosclerosis by inhibiting the Piezo1-YAP/JNK signaling pathway, suggesting its potential application in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.",
