  "title": "From feed formulation to frozen flesh: Hydrolysable tannin mitigates high-fat diet-induced quality deterioration in flesh of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) through enhancing antioxidant capacity, optimizing nutrient composition, and textural characteristics.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically evaluate the impact of adding hydrolysable tannin (HT, 1.25\u00a0g/kg) to a high-fat diet on the flesh quality of fish (Micropterus salmoides) after 12\u00a0weeks rearing. Results showed that high-fat diet supplemented with HT increased the content of crude protein and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and optimized the amino acid composition of flesh. Meanwhile, the high-fat diet reduced the antioxidant capacity, muscle fiber density, and collagen content of flesh, but HT supplementation counteracted these negative effects. According to metabolomics analysis, dietary HT reduced the abundance of hypoxanthine and inosine, suggesting that HT might potentially mitigate the deterioration of flesh by delaying the degradation of adenosine triphosphate. Short-term frozen storage analysis indicated that dietary HT contributed to maintain flesh color, texture, and pH, and reduce total volatile base nitrogen\u200c. This study provides insights for enhancing the nutritional value and flesh quality of fish fed high-fat diets.",
