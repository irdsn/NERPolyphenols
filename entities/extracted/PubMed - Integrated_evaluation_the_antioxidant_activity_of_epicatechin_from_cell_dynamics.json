  "abstract": "Oxidative damage has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous disorders by affecting the normal functions of several tissues. Further, oxidative stress acts within cells to influence cell morphology and the behavior of cell migration. The movement and migration of cells are crucial during the development of organisms as they transition from embryo to adult, and for the homeostasis of adult tissues. Epicatechin (EC) is a natural flavonoid derived mostly from tea, chocolate, and red wine. We investigated the protective impact of EC on D-galactose(D-gal)/rotenone-injured NIH3T3 cells and found alterations in cell dynamics throughout the procedure. The results reveal that D-gal/rotenone stimulation can cause the cell area to expand and the number of cellular protrusions to increase. EC intervention can considerably minimize the oxidative damage of rotenone on NIH3T3 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05) but showed little influence on cell damage induced by D-gal. Furthermore, the corrective ability of EC as an antioxidant is reflected in a dose-dependent effect on cell movement, including variations in movement speed and distance. Overall, from the perspective of cell morphology and cell motility, EC has a good protective impact on cells harmed by rotenone induced oxidative damage, as well as corrective properties as an antioxidant to balance intracellular oxidative stress, which allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of antioxidant performance of EC.",
