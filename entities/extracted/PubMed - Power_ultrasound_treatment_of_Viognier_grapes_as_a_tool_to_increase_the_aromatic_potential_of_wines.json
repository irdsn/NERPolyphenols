  "abstract": "High-power ultrasound is a novel and non-thermal technique normally used in red vinification to increase the extraction of phenolic compounds. However, few studies have been carried out on its effect on the extraction of aroma compounds and their precursors in white grapes. This study evaluates the effect of high-power ultrasound at winery scale in the maceration of Viognier grapes on the content of varietal volatile compounds (free and glycosidically bound) in musts and wines, in comparison with wines from direct pressing and from short skin maceration.",
