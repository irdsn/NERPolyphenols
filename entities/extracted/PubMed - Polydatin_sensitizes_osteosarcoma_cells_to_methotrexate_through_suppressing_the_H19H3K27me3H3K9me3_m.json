  "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant primary tumor in bone tissues, and Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as a chemotherapeutic drug for OS in clinical treatment. However, MTX resistance is a major challenge for OS patients. Polydatin (PD) is an extract derived from Reynoutria japonica Houtt and has been identified as a potential agent for reversing chemotherapy resistance in cancer. We therefore wondered whether PD could alleviate MTX resistance in OS.",
