  "abstract": "Sarcopenia refers to the progressive loss and atrophy of skeletal muscle function, often associated with aging or secondary to conditions involving systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that skeletal muscle function is not only influenced by physical, environmental, and genetic factors but is also significantly impacted by nutritional deficiencies. Natural compounds with antioxidant properties, such as resveratrol and vitamin D, have shown promise in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle cells. These antioxidants can slow down muscle atrophy by regulating mitochondrial functions and neuromuscular junctions. This review provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms leading to skeletal muscle atrophy and summarizes recent advances in using resveratrol and vitamin D supplementation for its prevention and treatment. Understanding these molecular mechanisms and implementing combined interventions can optimize treatment outcomes, ensure muscle function recovery, and improve the quality of life for patients.",
