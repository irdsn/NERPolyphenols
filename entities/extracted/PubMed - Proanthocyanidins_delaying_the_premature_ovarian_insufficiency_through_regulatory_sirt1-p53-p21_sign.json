  "abstract": "As women age, their ovarian follicle pool naturally declines. However, female germline stem cells (FGSCs) possess a unique ability to differentiate into oocytes and continuously self-renew, providing an effective means of delaying ovarian aging by replenishing the primordial follicle pool. Therefore, activating FGSCs is critical in reshaping and safeguarding ovarian function.",
