  "title": "Applications of Reverse Osmosis and Nanofiltration Membrane Process in Wine and Beer Industry.",
  "abstract": "Reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes are traditionally employed in wine and beer production for concentration, clarification, and stabilization. Their applications now extend to dealcoholization, addressing rising demand for low-alcohol beverages. RO/NF selectively reduce ethanol while retaining volatile aromas and non-volatile flavors, outperforming thermal methods that degrade sensory profiles. This review examines RO/NF roles in alcohol adjustment, sugar modification, and by-product recovery, emphasizing mechanisms and efficiency. Operational challenges such as membrane fouling (polysaccharides, polyphenols), selectivity-permeation flux trade-offs, and energy costs are assessed. By balancing tradition with innovation, RO/NF technologies offer transformative potential for meeting health and sustainability goals in beverage industries. However, gaps in standardization, sensory consistency, and cost-effectiveness necessitate targeted research to optimize industrial adoption and consumer acceptance.",
