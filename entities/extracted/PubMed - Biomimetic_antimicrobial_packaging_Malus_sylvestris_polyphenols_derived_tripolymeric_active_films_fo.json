  "abstract": "A novel active packaging film was developed by incorporating apple polyphenols (AP) as antibacterial and antioxidant agents into a biopolymer matrix of gelatin, carboxymethyl cellulose, and chitosan. Molecular interactions between AP and the film matrix were analyzed using molecular docking, supported by ATR-FTIR and XRD, indicating hydrogen bonding and crystallinity changes. AP incorporation significantly improved the film's tensile strength, oxygen, water, and UV barrier properties (decreases in transmittance from 60.76\u00a0% to 1.81\u00a0%). Additionally, water-related characteristics, opacity, and color varied with AP concentration. Atomic force microscopy showed surface morphological changes due to AP. The 6\u00a0% AP addition enhanced antioxidant activity up to 73.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.88\u00a0%. Furthermore, the tricomponent functional films exhibit strong antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, verified with AFM imaging of bacteria. The tricomponent active films were further utilized for beef preservation, and the results of TVBN, pH, and TBARS showed good compatibility of these films as active packaging, extending beef shelf life by up to 3\u00a0days by delaying spoilage. These films hold potential for food packaging, offering protection against mechanical stress, light exposure, microbial spoilage, and oxidative free radicals.",
