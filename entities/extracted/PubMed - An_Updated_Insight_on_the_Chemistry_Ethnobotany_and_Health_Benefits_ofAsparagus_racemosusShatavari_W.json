  "abstract": "Asparagus racemosus, more famous as Shatavari, is a popular medicinal plant with a broad species distribution across the Indian subcontinent as well as across the globe. The multidimensional therapeutic potential of this herb has earned it the title of \"Queen of Herbs.\" Shatavari is rich in bioactive constituents including alkaloids, carboxylic acids, polycyclic hydrocarbons, isoflavones, flavonoids, dihydrophenanthrene derivatives, furan derivatives, essential oils, sterols, and steroidal saponin (specifically Shatavarin-I to VI), distributed throughout the rhizome as well as in other parts of the plant. These compounds are frequently used in the treatment of several medical conditions, including dysentery, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, anxiety disorders, inflammation, tumors, mental disorders, hyperacidity, viral diseases, spasms, chronic fever, and rheumatism. In addition, Shatavari possesses antibacterial, adaptogenic, and antioxidant properties. Shatavarin IV, a sarsapogenin enriched in the roots of Shatavari, is especially beneficial for women's reproductive health and also acts as an effective stressbuster. It is used as a remedy for female infertility by boosting libido, managing sexual organ inflammation, facilitating folliculogenesis and ovulation, preparing the uterus for conception, preventing miscarriages, functioning as a postpartum tonic by enhancing lactation and restoring uterine and hormonal homeostasis. In this regard, a novel Asparagus root formulation, Shevari4T\u00ae,has been developed, with Shatavarin IV content exceeding 7.4%, which promises to deliver the goodness of Shatavari, especially for women. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the holistic health benefits of Shatavari, with particular emphasis on Shatavarin IV.Key teaching pointsAsparagus racemosus (Shatavari) is a perennial climber medicinal plant containing multiple bioactive constituents including selected steroidal saponins, namely, Shatavarin I - VI.Shatavarin I and Shatavarin IV are the most potent glycosides found in abundance in the roots of the plant.Shatavarin IV is comprising of two molecules of rhamnose and one glucose molecule, and basically it is a glycoside of sarsasapogenin.Shatavarin IV, a steroidal saponin from Asparagus racemosus, exhibits potent pharmacological effects including antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, antibacterial, antidiabetic and antihypertensive properties.It also augments female fertility and reproduction by facilitating folliculogenesis and ovulation, preparing the uterus for conception, preventing miscarriages, functioning as a postpartum tonic by enhancing lactation and restoring uterine and hormonal homeostasis.",
