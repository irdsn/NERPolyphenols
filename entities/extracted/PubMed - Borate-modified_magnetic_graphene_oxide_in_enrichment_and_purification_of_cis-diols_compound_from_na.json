  "abstract": "Black tartary buckwheat, rich in rutin, has been traditionally used for treating cardiovascular diseases, yet its efficient separation remains challenging. Herein, magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) was functionalized with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) via EDC/NHS coupling, forming MGO@APBA for selective rutin enrichment. Magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) was employed for rutin analysis. Adsorption performances suggest Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order model as best fit (Qm=\u00a080.18\u00a0mg\u00a0g-1). High satisfactory recovery (98.9\u00a0%-101.9\u00a0%), low limit of detection (0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0L-1), wide linearity range (20-200\u00a0mg\u00a0L-1) and good coefficient of determination (R2=\u00a00.994) were found. MGO@APBA demonstrated excellent selectivity through significant statistical (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03<0.05), reusability (>80\u00a0% adsorption efficiency after four cycles). MGO@APBA showed excellent selectivity and reusability, making it a promising tool for rutin purification. This study provides a strategy for rutin separation and highlights the potential of borate-functionalized nanomaterials in natural product extraction.",
