  "abstract": "Airway inflammation plays a major role in the development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Quercetin, which has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties reduces lung inflammation in mice displaying COPD-like lung disease. Previously we showed that quercetin was safely tolerated up to 2000 mg/day. We conducted a pilot Phase II clinical trial to examine the effects of quercetin on inflammation in COPD patients.",
