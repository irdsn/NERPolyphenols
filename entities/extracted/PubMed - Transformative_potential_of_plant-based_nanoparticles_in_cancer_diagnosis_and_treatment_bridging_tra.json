  "abstract": "Cancer is a primary global health concern, with an estimated 35.3 million cancer cases expected worldwide, representing a 76.6% increase in 2022, and 20 million by 2050, resulting from genetic mutation and environmental factors that cause uncontrolled cell growth. Other factors including smoking, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to carcinogens, UV radiation, and aging increase DNA damage. Current cancer treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery are effective, but those have significant effects like lack of specificity, development of drug resistance, and significant side effects to healthy tissues. An advancement to conventional therapies is plant-based nanoparticles as transformative approaches in cancer diagnosis and treatment. These nanoparticles synthesized using plant bioactive compounds like flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, and some metals-oxides like gold, silver, copper, zinc, etc. offer eco-friendly, cost-effective, and biocompatible alternatives. They enhance targeted drug delivery, allowing anticancer agents specifically to tumor cells, minimizing damage to health. Improves imaging techniques like MRI and fluorescence imaging, and helps early detection, cancer biomarkers, allowing for prompt intervention. Recent findings show that nanocarriers made from plant-based materials, such as polyphenols (curcumin, resveratrol) and plant-extracted metal nanoparticles (gold, silver), can improve drug stability and selectively target tumor cells. Plant-derived nanoparticles play a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy and nanovaccines. Biodegradable plant-based nanocarriers can deliver cancer vaccines, stimulating long-term immunity against tumors. Graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles synthesized from plant extracts can absorb near-infrared (NIR) light, generating heat to destroy cancer cells with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. This study discusses the types of plant-based nanoparticles like plant virus nanoparticles (TMV, PVX, CPMV), plant metallic nanoparticles (Au, Ag., Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, and Mn), and flavonoid nanoparticles found in cancer treatment, their significant roles, chemotherapy-based nanomedicines available in the medical field, and a detailed vision of nanomaterial applications in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and targeted drug delivery.",
