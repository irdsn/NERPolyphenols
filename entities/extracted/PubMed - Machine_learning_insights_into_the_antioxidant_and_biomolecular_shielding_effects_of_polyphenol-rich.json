  "abstract": "This study investigated the antioxidant and biomolecular shielding effects of polyphenol-rich extracts from 18 date palm pit varieties. Phytochemical profiling revealed significant varietal differences, with catechin (358.48\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g in Maghool) and gallic acid (34.55\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g in Khalas) as dominant compounds. Antioxidant assays demonstrated robust activity, with Shikat alkahlas showing 64.10\u00a0% DPPH inhibition and Maghool exhibiting the highest FRAP value (190.57\u00a0mmol Fe2+/100\u00a0g). Enzyme inhibition varied widely: Maghool inhibited tyrosinase by 65.40\u00a0%, while Shabebe showed 42.21\u00a0% \u03b1-amylase inhibition. Protective effects against DNA and BSA damage were pronounced in Sagay (39.99\u00a0% supercoiled DNA retention) and Jabri (98.95\u00a0% BSA protection). An XGBoost model predicted antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and protective activities with up to 92.57\u00a0% accuracy, identifying catechin and cinnamic acid as key predictors. These findings underscore the potential of date pits as sustainable sources of bioactive compounds for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.",
