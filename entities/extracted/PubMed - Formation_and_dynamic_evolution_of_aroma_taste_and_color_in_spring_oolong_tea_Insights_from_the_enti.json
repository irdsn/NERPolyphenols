  "abstract": "The distinctive flavor of oolong tea is derived from its complex processing techniques. In this study, comprehensive untargeted metabolomics were applied to investigate the effects of spring oolong tea processing on its aroma, taste, and color. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Tof-MS) identified 118 volatile and 79 non-volatile metabolites. Multivariate statistical analysis filtered 30 key metabolites. Indole, E-nerolidol, linalool, and geraniol were identified as crucial volatile compounds responsible for the characteristic floral and fruity aroma of spring oolong tea, with indole contributing significantly to its jasmine-like fragrance. The tea infusion color deepened as processing progressed but brightened after Killing Green. Changes in theaflavins and catechins were the main factors influencing oolong tea's color and taste. By analyzing the dynamic changes in key metabolites, this study reveals the formation of spring oolong tea's quality attributes.",
