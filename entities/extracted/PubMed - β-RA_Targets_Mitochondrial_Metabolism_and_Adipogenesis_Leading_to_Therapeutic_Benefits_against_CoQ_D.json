  "abstract": "Primary mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genes, leading to the abnormal function of specific mitochondrial pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a secondary event in more common pathophysiological conditions, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. In both cases, the improvement and management of mitochondrial homeostasis remain challenging. Here, we show that beta-resorcylic acid (\u03b2-RA), which is a natural phenolic compound, competed in vivo with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, which is the natural precursor of coenzyme Q biosynthesis. This led to a decrease in demethoxyubiquinone, which is an intermediate metabolite of CoQ biosynthesis that is abnormally accumulated inCoq9R239Xmice. As a consequence, \u03b2-RA rescued the phenotype ofCoq9R239Xmice, which is a model of primary mitochondrial encephalopathy. Moreover, we observed that long-term treatment with \u03b2-RA also reduced the size and content of the white adipose tissue (WAT) that is normally accumulated during aging in wild-type mice, leading to the prevention of hepatic steatosis and an increase in survival at the elderly stage of life. The reduction in WAT content was due to a decrease in adipogenesis, an adaptation of the mitochondrial proteome in the kidneys, and stimulation of glycolysis and acetyl-CoA metabolism. Therefore, our results demonstrate that \u03b2-RA acted through different cellular mechanisms, with effects on mitochondrial metabolism; as such, it may be used for the treatment of primary coenzyme Q deficiency, overweight, and hepatic steatosis.",
