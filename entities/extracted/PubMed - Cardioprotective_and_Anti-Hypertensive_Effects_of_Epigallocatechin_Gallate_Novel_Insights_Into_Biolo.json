  "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major catechin in green tea, is of considerable interest principally due to its proposed antihypertensive and cardioprotective properties. New research shows that EGCG can help relax the circulation of blood vessels, reduce arterial stiffness of arteries, and promote antioxidant activity promotion, which results in lowering blood pressure (BP) and better-improving heart health. It also affects signaling pathways related to nitric oxide (NO) production, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which are crucial for vascular homeostasis. Although animal research and clinical trials demonstrate that regular intake of EGCG significantly decreases BP and improves lipid profiles, further studies are needed to confirm these benefits in diverse populations. This review highlights the relevant biological data supporting these effects and the mechanisms by which EGCG impacts cardiovascular health. This review provides a new perspective on the many favorable effects of EGCG, such as its potential role in cardiovascular disease prevention, essential hypertension (HTN), and atherosclerosis. These results point to the need for more clinical trials aimed at determining whether EGCG may be used as a natural approach to reducing HTN and its cardiovascular complications through dietary interventions to enhance public health.",
