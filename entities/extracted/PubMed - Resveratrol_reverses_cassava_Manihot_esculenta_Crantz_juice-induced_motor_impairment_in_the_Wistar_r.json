  "abstract": "Long-term cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) intake has been associated with the development of neurological diseases characterized by motor impairment in humans and experimental animals. Thus, there is a need to identify the therapeutic effects of molecules to ameliorate said alterations, such as resveratrol, which was explored in the present study. Therefore, we evaluate whether the behavioral alterations associated with the chronic intake of cassava juice could be reversed with resveratrol.",
