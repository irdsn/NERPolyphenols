  "abstract": "Apples, a ubiquitous and beloved fruit, harbor a treasure trove of bioactive compounds, with apple polyphenols (APs) taking center stage. This review delves into the latest scientific advancements illuminating the anti-cancer and anti-aging properties of APs. We dissect the intricate mechanisms by which APs combat cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, highlighting their prowess in inducing apoptosis, inhibiting angiogenesis, and modulating cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, we explore the multifaceted ways APs combat aging, including their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, DNA protective effects, and ability to modulate cellular processes like autophagy and metabolism. This comprehensive review underscores the therapeutic promise of APs in promoting healthy aging and combating age-related diseases like cancer.",
