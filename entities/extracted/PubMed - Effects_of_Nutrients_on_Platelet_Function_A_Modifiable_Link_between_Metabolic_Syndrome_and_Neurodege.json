  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of vascular dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies underline that platelets play an important role in linking peripheral with central metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms. In this narrative review, we address the activation of platelets in metabolic syndrome, their effects on neuronal processes and the role of the mediators (e.g., serotonin, platelet-derived growth factor). Emerging evidence shows that nutritional compounds and their metabolites modulate these interactions-specifically, long chain fatty acids, endocannabinoids and phenolic compounds. We reviewed the role of activated platelets in neurovascular processes and nutritional compounds in platelet activation.",
