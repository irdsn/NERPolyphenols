  "abstract": "Current disposal methods for pomegranate peel (PP) waste are inadequate, resulting in environmental pollution. Given PP's therapeutic potential in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), elucidating its bioactive mechanisms is critical to guide its development into dietary supplements and promote sustainable recycling. In this study, bioinformatics and network analysis were employed to identify active compounds, key targets, and signaling pathways associated with PP's therapeutic effects. We identified 39 bioactive compounds (primarily polyphenols) and 106 key targets linked to IBS. Network analyses revealed that PP polyphenols mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation, modulate estrogen receptors to enhance gastrointestinal motility, and regulate ferroptosis. These findings underscore PP's potential as a therapeutic agent for IBS and provide a framework for repurposing food-processing byproducts.",
