  "abstract": "In response to the nitrate (NO3--N) and manganese (Mn) contamination in aquatic systems polluted by industrial and agricultural activities, this study isolated a strain Pseudomonas sp. XFQ that can simultaneously achieve Mn redox coupled denitrification. In the Mn(\u2161) oxidation-coupled denitrification system (carbon to nitrogen ratio = 2.0, Mn(\u2161) =\u202f10\u202fmg\u202fL-1, and pH =\u202f7.0), the denitrification process by strain XFQ reached 98\u202f% NO3--N elimination within 12\u202fh. Meanwhile, the Mn(\u2163)-driven denitrification system achieved 99\u202f% NO3--N removal within 16\u202fh at a MnO2dosage of 500\u202fmg\u202fL-1. A comparison between Mn(\u2161) oxidation and Mn(\u2163) reduction driven denitrification systems showed that the nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase levels, electron transfer capacity, the intensity of Mn(III), and the membrane-intact cell counts are all lower in the Mn reduction-driven system. The introduction of gallic acid (GA) enhanced the electron transfer chain activity by regulating the complex stability of Mn(\u2162), redox-mediating ability, and the denitrification enzyme activity in the Mn(\u2163) reduction-coupled denitrification system, while promoting the co-metabolic degradation efficiency of NO3--N and diclofenac. This significantly enhances Mn transformation efficiency in the Mn redox-coupled denitrification system, thereby improving Mn cycling, denitrification effectiveness, and DCF removal.",
