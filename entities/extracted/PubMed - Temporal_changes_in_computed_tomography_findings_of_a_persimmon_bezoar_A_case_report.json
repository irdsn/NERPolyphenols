  "abstract": "Gastric bezoars are masses of indigestible material that accumulate in the stomach, causing nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Persimmon bezoars (diospyrobezoars), which comprise tannins and fibers from persimmons, are relatively rare but may cause significant gastric complications, including gastric outlet obstruction or ileus. Although computed tomography (CT) is a useful imaging tool, diagnosing bezoars can be challenging because their density is similar to that of food debris and gastric content.",
