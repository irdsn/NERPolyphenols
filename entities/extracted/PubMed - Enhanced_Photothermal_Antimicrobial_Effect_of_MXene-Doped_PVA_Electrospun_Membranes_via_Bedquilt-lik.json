  "title": "Enhanced Photothermal Antimicrobial Effect of MXene-Doped PVA Electrospun Membranes via \"Bedquilt-like\" Synergistically Heat Modulation and Biological Effects of Bacteria-Derived OMVs for Infected Wound Treatment.",
  "abstract": "Current treatments for skin infections employing single-agent antimicrobials have demonstrated pronounced limitations. Here, we have engineered an efficient antibacterial composite consisting of MXene and poly(vinyl alcohol) electrospun fibrous membranes, which are further functionalized with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) using a tannic acid (TA) bridge. Upon near-infrared irradiation, OMVs augment the photothermal properties of MXene due to their \"bedquilt effect\". Meanwhile, the temperature rise facilitates active antibacterial substance release by increasing the permeability of the OMVs. The synergistically enhanced antimicrobial ability of the OMVs and photothermal materials achieves a potentiated antibacterial effect, resulting in a near 100% antibacterial efficacy in vitro and in vivo. This multifunctional, antibiotic-free dressing membrane, which integrates photothermal and biological antibacterial properties, presents a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of skin wound infections.",
