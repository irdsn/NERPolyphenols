  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The current investigation aimed to assess the chemoprotective effects of pterostilbene against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colorectal cancer in mice. An in-silico study was conducted to perform docking studies against nuclear factor kappa factor (NF-\u03baB). CRC was induced in mice by administering DMH (20\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously, and the mice were subsequently administered various dosages of pterostilbene (5, 10, and 15\u2009mg/kg). At the end of the study, various biochemical parameters, including inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory markers, and antioxidant enzymes, were examined. Additionally, the mice's stools were collected for the analysis of intestinal microbiota. A total of 5 hydrogen bonds were identified between NF-\u03baB and pterostilbene using LigPlot+. Pterostilbene significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) reduced tumor incidence, tumor weight, and increased body weight. Pterostilbene significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) altered the levels of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase as well as the activity of both phase I and phase II enzymes. Furthermore, pterostilbene significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-1\u03b2, while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. Pterostilbene considerably suppressed the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2, as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase and simultaneously elevated the levels of apoptosis-related parameters, including caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. Moreover, pterostilbene significantly reduced the abundance of Staphylococcus in the intestinal microbiota and enhanced the levels of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus. Pterostilbene demonstrated a chemoprotective effect against CRC by effectively reducing oxidative stress, mitigating inflammatory responses, and inducing alterations in gut microbiota levels.",
