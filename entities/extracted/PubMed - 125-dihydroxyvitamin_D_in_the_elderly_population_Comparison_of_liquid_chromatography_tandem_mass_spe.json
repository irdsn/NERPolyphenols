  "abstract": "1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the biologically active form of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2(ergocalciferol). The determination of 1,25(OH)2D is clinically relevant in the diagnostics of vitamin D metabolism disorders, PTH-independent hypercalceamia and hypophosphatemic syndromes. The quantitative assessment of 1,25(OH)2D may be a challenge since it circulates in picomolar concentrations in the blood.",
