  "abstract": "Prunus cerasusvar. Marasca (Rosaceae) is an important Croatian cultivar, known wordwide for the production of Luxardo maraschino liqueur, which occurs in the eastern Po Valley of Italy. Besides liqueur, Marasca is attractive for its beneficial effects on human health and well-being. The undifferentiated in vitro cell cultures of Marasca were investigated as a source of healthy products. The in vitro conditions for obtaining callus and suspension cultures under photoperiod were defined. The cell lines were evaluated for growth rate, total phenol and proanthocyanidin contents, and antioxidant activities via colorimetric assays. The best cell lines were also subcultured in darkness, studying the importance of the light parameter in the possible industrial scaling-up. The juices extracted from the obtained biomasses were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS and six flavanone derivatives, among which naringenin and its glucoside were identified. The quantitative analysis, pursued during the cell growth cycle, revealed that the flavanone content was higher at the end of the growth cycle (28th day) and that the total content of identified flavanone compounds varied from 17.22 to 79.22 \u03bcg/mL of juice. The results of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities on Caco-2 cells support the potential applications of this material in human health.",
