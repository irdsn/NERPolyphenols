  "abstract": "Pinostrobin (PIN), a natural flavonoid found in Boesenbergia rotunda, Alpinia zerumbet, and other botanicals, has shown promising anticancer potential due to its multitargeted mechanisms and favorable safety profile. This review consolidates current evidence on PIN's anticancer properties, focusing on its molecular mechanisms, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and therapeutic potential. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar to identify preclinical studies on PIN's bioactivity, PK, and toxicity. PIN exerts potent anticancer effects by inducing ROS-mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest via p21 upregulation and cyclin D1 suppression, and reducing proliferation and inducing cytotoxicity. It also inhibits metastasis by targeting migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis. PK data reveal good intestinal absorption and metabolic transformation primarily, although limited solubility and brain penetration remain challenges. Toxicity studies show no adverse effects at therapeutic doses (\u2264\u2009100 mg/kg), with selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells and protective antioxidant effects in normal tissues. Beyond oncology, PIN also exhibits several pharmacological properties. PIN's ability to target key cancer pathways, along with its low toxicity and broad pharmacological potential, makes it a strong candidate for adjuvant therapy. The novelty of this study is its integrated analysis of PIN's anticancer mechanisms, PK, and safety, along with proposed strategies to bridge the gap toward clinical application. Clinical trials remain essential to confirm its efficacy.",
