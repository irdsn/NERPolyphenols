  "abstract": "Aggregation and deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b242) in extracellular spaces are key neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extracellular A\u03b242 aggregates not only impair the function of the extracellular matrix but also directly damage brain cells through binding interactions. Chemically, tea polyphenols are amphiphilic, similar to the A\u03b242 molecule. This study found that catechin (CA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) effectively bound to A\u03b242 monomers (A\u03b242M) and oligomers (A\u03b242O), preventing A\u03b242 aggregation; in contrast, EGCG also showed some binding to protofibrils (A\u03b242P) and fibrils (A\u03b242F), slightly inhibiting their development. In the presence of A\u03b242M and A\u03b242 aggregates in vitro, CA and EGCG demonstrated considerable protective effects on neural and vascular endothelial cells. These effects corresponded with the ability of CA and EGCG (particularly CA) to preserve A\u03b242M's targeting and binding to these cells, while they (especially EGCG) blocked or inhibited A\u03b242O's targeting and binding. Molecular docking revealed that both CA and EGCG effectively maintained the active conformation of A\u03b242M; in contrast, EGCG also effectively rendered A\u03b242O units inactive, primarily by disrupting and covering the hydrophobic clusters. Furthermore, CA and EGCG improved the AD brain microenvironment, including reducing A\u03b242 plaque burden and supporting brain cell populations. In conclusion, CA and EGCG inhibited the structure, bioactivity, and cell-targeting ability of A\u03b242 aggregates; however, they protected these aspects of A\u03b242M. These findings are essential for understanding the neuroprotective mechanisms of plant polyphenols.",
