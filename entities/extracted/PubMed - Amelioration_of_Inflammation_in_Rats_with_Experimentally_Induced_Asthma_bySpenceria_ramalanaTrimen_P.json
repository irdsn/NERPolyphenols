  "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects millions globally and poses a serious public health challenge. Current therapeutic strategies, including corticosteroids, are constrained by variable patient responses and adverse effects. In this study, a polyphenolic extract derived from the Tibetan medicinal plantSpenceria ramalanaTrimen (SRT) was employed and shown to improve experimentally (ovalbumin + cigarette smoke, OVA + CS) induced asthma in rats. Initially, the potential therapeutic mechanism of the polyphenolic components in SRT on OVA + CS-induced asthma was predicated by network pharmacology analysis. Subsequently, in vivo experiments identified that SRT polyphenols exhibit significant anti-asthmatic activities, primarily mediated by lowering inflammatory cell counts such as the WBC (white blood cell), eosinophils, and neutrophils, decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-\u03b1), alleviating lung histological damage (reduced inflammation, collagen deposition, and mucus secretion), and enhancing the epithelial barrier integrity (upregulation of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1). Additionally, SRT polyphenols downregulated the PI3K/Akt (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B) signaling pathway, improved gut microbiota disruption, and regulated fecal metabolites (glucose-6-glutamate, PS (16:0/0:0), 8-aminocaprylic acid, galactonic acid, Ascr#10, 2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydroxyheptanoic acid, phosphodimethylethanolamine, muramic acid, 9-oxohexadeca-10e-enoic acid, and sedoheptulose) in asthmatic rats. In conclusion, SRT polyphenols exerted multifaceted protective effects against OVA + CS-induced asthma in rats, highlighting their potential value in preventing asthma via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",
