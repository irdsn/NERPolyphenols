  "abstract": "This study evaluated the various iron forms, ferrous sulfate (FS), ferrous gluconate (FG), ferric sodium EDTA (FSE), ferric pyrophosphate (FPP), ferrous fumarate (FF), ferrous bis-glycinate (FB), and electrolytic iron (EI) for fortifying Arabica coffee. FSE-fortified coffee (FC) exhibited the highest solubility and stability, with an iron recovery of 4.702\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0mL, followed by FB-FC (3.681\u00a0mg), FS-FC (3.345\u00a0mg), and FG-FC (3.435\u00a0mg). ATR-FTIR confirmed minimal interaction between FSE and coffee polyphenols, ensuring high retention and low complexation (<1.0\u00a0mmol FeCl\u2083/TAE). Sensory analysis linked FSE-FC to desirable aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel, whereas EI-FC and FF-FC exhibited off-flavors. GC-MS profile indicated a minimal impact on key volatile compounds. These findings confirm that FSE, followed by FB, FS, and FG, are the most effective iron fortificants for coffee while preserving sensory and physicochemical properties, thereby enhancing coffee as a functional food that promotes better public health.",
