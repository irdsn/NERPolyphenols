  "abstract": "Many patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BCRPC) prefer to delay androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) due to its adverse effects, highlighting the need for better-tolerated, effective alternatives. A subgroup analysis of our prior Phase II trial showed that muscadine grape skin extract (MPX) increased PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients with SOD2 Ala/Ala variant which provided the rationale for this trial.",
