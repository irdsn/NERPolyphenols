  "abstract": "As a \"clean labelled\" food additive, extruded Tartary buckwheat flour (ETBF) was used to enhance the eating quality of functional coarse cereal foods. However, it is unclear whether it can enhance the quality of the traditional Chinese starchy food buckwheat wantuo (BWT). This study investigated how blending ETBF at different ratios (5\u00a0%, 10\u00a0%, and 15\u00a0%) affected the physicochemical properties of Tartary buckwheat flour (TBF) and BWT quality. The results revealed degradation of amylopectin and amylose during extrusion, along with changes in colour, hydration, and pasting properties of TBF due to blending. Blending also improved the total polyphenol content (TPC), antioxidant activity, texture, and anti-digestibility of BWT. The evolution of starch conformation and polyphenol state influenced texture and digestion, with the local concentration ratio between the host and the guest being a key factor. Sensory evaluation combined with digestion data indicated that a blending ratio of 10\u00a0% was optimal. These findings provide valuable insights into developing functional coarse cereal foods.",
