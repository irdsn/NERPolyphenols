  "title": "Development of a chemometrics-assisted electrochemical sensor applied to gallic acid quantification in food samples.",
  "abstract": "Gallic acid (GA) is an abundant natural phenolic compound found in foods such as tea, fruits, and beverages. Quantifying GA remains a key research area in analytical chemistry. Traditional methods, such as liquid chromatography, are time-consuming, highlighting the need for faster and more efficient techniques to quantify GA concentration. This study proposes an approach based on the MCR-ALS algorithm to model second-order voltammetric data obtained by varying the scan rate. Data preprocessing and subsequent mathematical modeling enabled the quantification of GA with a detection limit of 5.9\u00a0mg\u00a0L-1, below the stipulated concentrations for the analyte in various food matrices. Quantification was achieved even in the presence of unmodeled interferences, leveraging the second-order capabilities of multivariate calibration methods. This approach allows for accurate results to be obtained in a direct, fast, and reliable manner, representing a breakthrough in food industry quality control and opening new perspectives for food quality assessment.",
