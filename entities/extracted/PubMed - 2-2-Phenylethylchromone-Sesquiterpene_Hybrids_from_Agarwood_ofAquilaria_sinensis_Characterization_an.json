  "abstract": "Aquisinenins G-I (1-3), three new 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone-sesquiterpene hybrids, were isolated from the ethanol extract of Hainan agarwood derived fromAquilaria sinensis. Spectroscopic techniques, such as1D and2D NMR and HRESIMS, were used to determine their structures. Experimental and computed ECD data were compared to confirm their absolute configurations. Compounds1-3are uncommon dimeric derivatives of 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone-sesquiterpene, characterized by the fusion of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone with agarofuran or agarospirane-type sesquiterpene units by an ester linkage. Compound1inhibited nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, showing an IC50value of 22.31 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcM. The neuroprotective effects of compounds1and3against H2O2-induced apoptosis were assessed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Compound1demonstrated cytotoxicity with IC50values of 72.37 \u00b1 0.20 \u03bcM against K562 and 61.47 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcM against BEL-7402, while compounds2and3showed cytotoxicity across all five tested human cancer cell lines.",
