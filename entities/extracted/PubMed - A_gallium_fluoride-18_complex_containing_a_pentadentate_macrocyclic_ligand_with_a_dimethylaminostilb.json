  "abstract": "The molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease is associated with the presence of aggregates of amyloid-\u03b2, a 39-43 amino acid peptide, that form amyloid plaques in the brain. Appropriately substituted stilbene derivatives, radiolabelled with positron-emitting radionuclides, that bind selectively to amyloid-\u03b2 plaques can be used to assess plaque burden by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In this work, a substituted pentadentate ligand based on a triazacyclononane backbone (H2L1) with one pendent stilbene functional group and two pendent carboxylate groups was synthesised. The new ligand binds to amyloid-\u03b2 plaques present in human brain tissue. Non-conventional radiolabelling with fluorine-18 was achieved by the formation of a GaIII-[18F]F-coordinate bond to give a complex, [18F][GaL1F]. This ligand can also be radiolabelled with gallium-68 to give [68Ga][GaL1F], or copper-64 to give [64Cu][CuL1]. Thein vivobiodistribution of [18F][GaL1F] and [64Cu][CuL1] was evaluated in mice, revealing that the initial uptake of [18F][GaL1F] and [64Cu][CuL1] in the brain was 0.85 \u00b1 0.13% IA g-1and 0.71 \u00b1 0.03% IA g-1respectively. An increase in radioactivity in bone at later time points suggested that [18F][GaL1F] is unstablein vivo.",
