  "abstract": "Yerba mat\u00e9 (YM), a traditional herbal beverage made fromIlex paraguariensis, contains bioactive compounds like polyphenols and alkaloids known for their metabolic benefits. This study investigates YM's incretin effects, focusing on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP).Methods: Male and female C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with YM for four weeks. Post-supplementation, GLP-1 and GIP gene expression levels were analyzed in jejunal mucosa, and plasma hormone concentrations were measured. Additionally, in vitro experiments were conducted using GLUTag L-cells to evaluate the direct effects of YM and its metabolites, including ferulic acid and dihydroferulic acid, on GLP-1 secretion. Gene expression analysis involved quantitative real-time PCR, while hormone levels were assessed via ELISA.",
