  "abstract": "The prevention and treatment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) urgently require safe and effective nutritional intervention strategies. Polyphenol extracts from sugarcane molasses (SP) show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, yet their protective effects against ALD have not been elucidated. This study explored the therapeutic potential of SP in alcohol-induced chronic liver damage.",
