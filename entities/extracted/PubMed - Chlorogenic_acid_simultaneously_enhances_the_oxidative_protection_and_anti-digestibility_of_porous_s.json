  "abstract": "Porous starch (PS) has been utilized as an oral protective carrier to enhance the oxidative stability of liposoluble nutrients. However, PS releases more glucose during digestion, thereby increasing the risk of chronic diseases. Chlorogenic acid (CA) has excellent antioxidant properties and enhances the starch digestion resistance. To simultaneously enhance the oxidative protection and anti-digestibility, PS was blended with CA. Morphological analysis revealed that PSs with pores absorbed liposoluble substances. Surface area, total pore volume, and oxidative stability analyses demonstrated that rice starch (RS) enzymatically hydrolyzed for 12\u202fh (PS12) loaded more substances and exerted a better protective effect in cooperation with CA. Simulated digestion confirmed that PS12-CA1 had the best anti-digestibility among PS12-CAs and a similar digestibility as RS. Additionally, CA treatment resulted in more anti-digestive V-type crystals in PSs, which resisted digestion. This study showed that the combination of PS and CA simultaneously enhanced oxidative protection and reduced the digestibility of PS. Thus, CA treatment makes PS a better oral nutrient delivery.",
