  "abstract": "Recent studies on natural antioxidant compounds have highlighted their potentiality against various pathological conditions. The present review aims to selectively evaluate the benefits of catechins and their polymeric structure on metabolic syndrome, a common disorder characterized by a cluster of three main risk factors: obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Patients with metabolic syndrome suffer chronic low inflammation state and oxidative stress both conditions effectively countered by flavanols and their polymers. The mechanism behind the activity of these molecules has been highlighted and correlated with the characteristic features present on their basic flavonoidic skelethon, as well as the efficient doses needed to perform their activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The amount of evidence provided in this review offers a starting point for flavanol dietary supplementation as a potential strategy to counteract several metabolic targets associated with metabolic syndrome and suggests a key role of albumin as flavanol-delivery system to the different target of action inside the organism.",
