  "abstract": "This study investigated the anticancer effects of purple carrot extract (PCE) and its key bioactive substance, chlorogenic acid (CHA), on MDA-MB-231 cells and elucidated the mechanisms of apoptosis and anticancer activity. The effects of CHA treatment on the growth of HEK-293 and MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed, and CHA selectively inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231, indicating specific inhibitory effect on breast cancer. When PCE and CHA were treated to MDA-MB-231 cells, an increase in in the expression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins, includingBcl-2-associated x (Bax), andcaspase-9, while the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) decreased (p<\u20090.05). In conclusion, the study substantiates the potential of CHA, a key bioactive substance in PCE, as a potent anticancer agent, highlighting its superior efficacy in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth through the regulation of apoptosis-related genes and protein expression.",
