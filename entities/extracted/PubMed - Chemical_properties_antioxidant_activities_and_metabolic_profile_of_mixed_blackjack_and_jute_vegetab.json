  "abstract": "The study assessed the secondary metabolite profile and antioxidant capacities of two Indigenous leafy vegetables: blackjack (Bidens pilosa) and jute (Corchorus olitorius). These vegetables were sun-dried and mixed in different ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30), with unblended samples as controls. Standard methods determined their total phenolic content, antioxidant capacities, total carotenoid, and beta-carotene. Results indicated that combining blackjack with jute improved their chemical properties and reduced antinutritional activities. The vitamin C content of mixed vegetables reached 51.96\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, while total phenolic content was 1.75\u00a0\u03bcg/mL GAE. Metabolic profiling showed both vegetables shared some secondary metabolites, but certain flavonoids were unique to blackjack. This suggests that consuming these vegetables mixed could enhance health benefits by providing a wider range of nutrients and bioactive compounds compared to individual consumption.",
