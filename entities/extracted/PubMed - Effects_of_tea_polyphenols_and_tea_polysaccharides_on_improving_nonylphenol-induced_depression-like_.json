  "abstract": "Exposure to nonylphenol (NP) has been linked to depressive-like behaviors, while tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of depression. This study investigates and compares the effects of tea polyphenols (TPs) and tea polysaccharides (TPSs) in alleviating NP-induced depressive-like behaviors, focusing on neuronal apoptosis and disrupted monoamine neurotransmitter secretion.",
