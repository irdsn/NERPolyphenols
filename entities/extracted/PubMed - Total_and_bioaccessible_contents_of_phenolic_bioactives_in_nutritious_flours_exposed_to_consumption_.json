  "abstract": "There is growing interest in quantifying phenolic bioactives (PBs) in food matrices, including a variety of nutritious flours. The objective of this study apply a factorial design to determine the total (TT) and bioaccessible (TB) levels of PBs in 26 nutritious flours, using the INFOGEST in vitro digestion method. Acids (gallic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, sinapic and ellagic) and flavonoids (catechin, rutin, quercetin and kaempferol) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). TT ranged, in \u03bcg\u00a0g-1, from 3.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27 (p-coumaric acid) to 3803\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0217 (rutin). TB, in \u03bcg\u00a0g-1, ranged from <0.17 to 1.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 (ellagic acid) to <0.16 to 88.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72 (catechin). Significant concentrations of CP in nutritious flours - eggplant (FBJ), orange (FLJ) and grape seed (FSU) - are relevant to profile these samples and help consumers incorporate them into their daily diets.",
