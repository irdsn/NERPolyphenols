  "title": "A Review of Natural and Synthetic Chalcones as Anticancer Agents Targeting Topoisomerase Enzymes.",
  "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driving the search for innovative and selective therapeutic agents. Topoisomerases I and II are essential enzymes involved in key cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription. They have emerged as valuable anticancer targets; thus, many inhibitors of topoisomerases have been designed and some of them are considered to be major anticancer agents such as anthracyclines, etoposide or irinotecan. A great deal of attention is currently being paid to chalcones, a class of naturally occurring compounds, since they exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including anticancer properties. These compounds are characterized by an open-chain structure and an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl moiety that enables interaction with cellular targets. Recent studies aiming to design anti-topoisomerase agents have identified both natural and synthetic chalcones, including chalcone-based hybrids. This review highlights the structural diversity of chalcones as topoisomerase inhibitors and particular attention is given to structure-activity relationship studies and molecular hybridization strategies aimed at optimizing the pharmacological profile of chalcones. These findings underline the potential of chalcones as promising scaffolds in the design of next-generation anticancer agents.",
