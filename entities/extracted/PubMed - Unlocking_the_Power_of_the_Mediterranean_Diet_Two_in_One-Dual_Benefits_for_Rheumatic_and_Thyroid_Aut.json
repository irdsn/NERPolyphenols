  "abstract": "In recent years, autoimmune diseases are becoming more and more prevalent worldwide, with this rapid rise being influenced by environmental factors linked to lifestyle changes in modern societies. In this context, the role of diet has been the topic of extensive research as evidence has mounted that particular dietary patterns may contribute to or modulate autoimmunity. The present review specifically focuses on the Mediterranean diet (MD) as a whole dietary pattern, and on its peculiar components, such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), polyphenols and fiber. We explored their potential benefits in a spectrum of both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders, including rheumatic diseases (like rheumatic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus), and thyroid diseases (like Hashimoto's thyroiditis), since they often occur in the same individuals. Here, we offer a comprehensive review about the influence of dietary factors on these autoimmune diseases and potential translation into therapeutic interventions, as an adjuvant therapeutic approach to improve autoimmunity-related outcomes.",
