  "abstract": "Plantago ovatahas been utilized as an effective natural remedy with minimal side effects, offering a promising alternative to synthetic pharmaceuticals. The supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) ofPlantago ovataleaves yielded 0.417 g and 0.532 g at 40 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, respectively. The 40 \u00b0C extract exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 15.62 \u00b5g/mL and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) as low as 31.25 \u00b5g/mL againstBacillus subtilisandCandida albicans. In contrast, the 80 \u00b0C extract demonstrated reduced activity, with MICs and MBCs up to 250 and 500 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The 40 \u00b0C extract also showed superior lipase inhibition (IC50= 17.21 \u00b5g/mL) compared to the 80 \u00b0C extract (IC50= 26.42 \u00b5g/mL), although orlistat remained the most potent (IC50= 6.02 \u00b5g/mL). In addition, cytotoxicity assays revealed stronger effects of the 40 \u00b0C extract on Caco-2 colon cancer cells (IC50= 109.47 \u00b5g/mL) compared to the 80 \u00b0C extract (IC50= 174.81 \u00b5g/mL). These results suggest that the lower-temperature SFE ofP. ovatayields extracts with enhanced antimicrobial, anti-obesity, and anticancer activities, supporting its potential for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.",
