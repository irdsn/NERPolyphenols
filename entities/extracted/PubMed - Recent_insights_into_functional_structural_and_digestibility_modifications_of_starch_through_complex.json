  "abstract": "Starch-polyphenol complexes, formed through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, significantly alter starch's functional, structural, and digestive properties. These complexes enhance thermal stability, reduce starch digestibility, and slow glucose release, offering potential benefits for glycemic control and functional food development. Polyphenols, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, lignans, and stilbenes, form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with amylose, potentially increasing resistant starch (RS) content and lowering the glycemic index of foods, which may benefit individuals with diabetes. However, the effectiveness of these complexes depends on factors such as polyphenol structure, starch type, and processing conditions. In some cases, processing may degrade polyphenols, potentially enhancing starch digestibility. Future research should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms, validating health benefits through in vivo studies, and optimizing processing techniques for functional foods targeting glycemic control. This will maximize the potential of starch-polyphenol complexes in developing healthier, more sustainable food solutions.",
