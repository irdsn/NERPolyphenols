  "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistantKlebsiella pneumoniae(CRKp) infection poses a significant global public health challenge, with the misuse of antibiotics further contributing to the development of resistance and triggering harmful inflammatory responses. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by CRKp under sub-lethal concentration of MEM pressure (KOMV-MEM) exhibit enhanced virulence and greater efficiency in transferring resistance genes.",
