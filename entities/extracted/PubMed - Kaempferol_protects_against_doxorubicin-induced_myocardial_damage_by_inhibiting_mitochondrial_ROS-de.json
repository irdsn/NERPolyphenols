  "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is limited in clinical application due to its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative therapeutic molecules or drugs for mitigating DOX-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC). In this study aimed to explore underlying mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of Kaempferol (KP) against DIC.",
