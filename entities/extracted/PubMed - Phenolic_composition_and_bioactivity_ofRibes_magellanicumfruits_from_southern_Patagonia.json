  "abstract": "EightRibes magellanicumcollections from three different places in southern Patagonia were compared for content of different groups of phenolics, antioxidant capacity and inhibition of enzymes related to metabolic syndrome (\u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase). The sample with the highest antioxidant capacity was assessed for glutathione (GSH) synthesis stimulation in human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells. The chemical profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS) and the main phenolics were quantified. The samples from Navarino Island and Reserva Nacional Magallanes showed higher content of anthocyanins and caffeoylquinic acid, with better activity towards \u03b1-glucosidase and antioxidant capacity. A sample from Omora (Navarino Island), significantly increased intracellular GSH content in AGS cells. Some 70 compounds were identified in the fruit extracts by HPLC-MS/MS. The glucoside and rutinoside from delphinidin and cyanidin and 3-caffeoylquinic acid were the main compounds. Different chemical profiles were found according to the collection places.",
