  "abstract": "The rolling-cutting process (RCP) is a crucial process in crush-tear-curl (CTC) black tea, but its quality formation is far from clear. This study aims to elucidate the dynamics of sensory quality and metabolites through quantitative descriptive analysis, headspace solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",
