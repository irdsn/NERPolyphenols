  "abstract": "Formulations based on a mixture of corn: lentil flours (70:30) (93.75%), salt (1.25%), sugar (5%), 5 or 20% of Hylon\u00aeV, were fortified with 5 and 20% of fermented Cabernet Sauvignon grape skin or seed, and unfermented Chardonnay grape seed flours, and evaluated for their functional components. The incorporation of winemaking by-products increased the dietary fibre content. Soluble sugars and arabinoxylans content depended only on corn:lentil flours presence. The total starch content varied between 42 .55\u2009g/100g to 58.41\u2009g/100g and the highest concentrations of resistant starch were determined in formulations with 20% Hylon\u00aeV. Total phenols, total flavonoids, and anthocyanins, were higher in all formulations with 20% fermented Cabernet Sauvignon skin or unfermented Chardonnay seed flours, regardless the content of corn:lentil flours. Winemaking by-products represent potential functional and prebiotic novel ingredients for new functional food products.",
