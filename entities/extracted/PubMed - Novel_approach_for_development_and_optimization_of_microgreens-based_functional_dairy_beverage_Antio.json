  "abstract": "This study optimizes a microgreens-based dairy (lassi) beverage using response surface methodology to enhance antioxidant composition, sensory attributes, and shelf stability. The ideal formulation (9.189\u00a0% microgreen juice, 60\u00a0% dahi, and 15.311\u00a0% water) achieved a desirability score of 0.781, significantly improving bioactive compounds. The optimized lassi contained phenolics (44.14\u00a0mg GAE/100\u00a0g), flavonoids (22.62\u00a0mg QUE/100\u00a0g), anthocyanins (37.91\u00a0\u03bcmol/100\u00a0g), and ascorbic acid (59.32\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g), with an acceptability rating of 8.29. Kinetic modeling assessed bioactive stability under varying storage conditions, with the highest retention at 5\u00a0\u00b0C after 15-days. Temperature-dependent degradation rates were analyzed using the Arrhenius, Eyring, and Ball models, while shelf-life prediction was based on a zero-order reaction model combined with the Arrhenius equation. The estimated shelf life at 5\u00a0\u00b0C based on microbial load was 9.33\u00a0days (t1/2), with production cost, aligning with market trends. These findings highlight commercial potential of radish sango microgreens in developing a nutritious, antioxidant-rich lassi beverage.",
