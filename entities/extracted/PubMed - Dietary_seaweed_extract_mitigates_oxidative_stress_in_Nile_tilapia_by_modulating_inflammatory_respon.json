  "abstract": "Extreme water temperature affects the well-being of all aquatic animals, including fish. Higher temperatures can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce oxidative stress and negatively impact fish health and well-being. This study investigated the protective effects of seaweed extract on growth, antioxidant status, inflammatory responses, and gut microbiota to gain a better understanding of the acclimatization ability of Nile tilapia,Oreochromis niloticusin response to oxidative stress caused by high water temperatures.",
