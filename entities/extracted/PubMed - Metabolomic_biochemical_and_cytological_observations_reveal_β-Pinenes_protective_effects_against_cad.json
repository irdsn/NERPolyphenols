  "abstract": "Sea rice (Haidao 86) is a vital cultivar that could be cultivated in saline soil but is sensitive to heavy metal stress, and cadmium (Cd) stress in eastern coastal parts of China is frequently a great hazard. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research on the metabolic pathways involved in the detoxification of Cd stress in sea rice. Here, we added a kind of monoterpene hormone, (1S)-(-)-\u03b2-Pinene (\u03b2P), in Cd (100\u00a0mg/kg) stressed experiment to study its interaction with sea rice. Multiple Morphological traits were significantly rescued after the application of \u03b2P. Similarly, Cd alleviation by \u03b2P was also demonstrated in physio-chemical indicators. Cd contents in roots, leaves, grains, H2O2, and MDA contents have decreased by 28.1\u00a0%, 50.9\u00a0%, 51.4\u00a0%, 18.2\u00a0%, and 18.0\u00a0%, respectively, with the presence of \u03b2P compared to Cd alone. SOD, POD, CAT, and GPX activities were elevated by 17.1\u00a0%, 40.0\u00a0%, 12.4\u00a0%, and 22.5\u00a0%, respectively, and contents of GSH and APX were also significantly modulated after the supplementation of \u03b2P. Transmission electron microscopy also indicated that the Cd+\u03b2P group had intact cellular structure compared to the Cd group. Through metabolomic analysis, 27 and 31 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified from CKvsCd and CdvsCd+\u03b2P. According to the results, carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. I-inositol, Gluconapoleiferin), phenylpropanoid (lignan, flavonoids) biosynthesis (e.g. Cyanidin, Leucoside), terpenoids, and alkaloids biosynthesis, were all significantly regulated with the presence of \u03b2P. Our study provided a detailed understanding of the mechanism behind Cd-stress tolerance and will aid in developing Cd tolerance in sea rice.",
