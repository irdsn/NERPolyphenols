  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the degeneration of cholinergic neurons, which is primarily driven by the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme and oxidative stress. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of the cannabis-containing herbal remedy Suk-Saiyasna in alleviating amyloid \u03b242 (A\u03b242)-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The DPPH radical-scavenging activity and inhibitory effects on AChE were evaluated in vitro. The AChE inhibitory potential of 167 ligands, including cannabinoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids derived from Suk-Saiyasna, was assessed using ADMET analysis and molecular docking techniques. The results demonstrated that the Suk-Saiyasna extract exhibited a DPPH radical scavenging effect with an IC50value of 27.40 \u00b1 1.15 \u00b5g/mL and notable AChE inhibitory activity with an IC50of 1.25 \u00b1 0.35 mg/mL. Importantly, at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, the extract significantly protected cells from A\u03b242-induced stress compared to controls. Docking studies revealed that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), mesuaferrone B, piperine, \u03b2-sitosterol, and chlorogenic acid exhibited substantial binding affinities to AChE, surpassing reference drugs like galantamine and rivastigmine. Furthermore, in silico ADMET predictions indicated that \u03949-THC and piperine possessed favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, including solubility, absorption, and blood-brain barrier permeability, with no neurotoxicity or carcinogenicity associated with \u03949-THC.",
