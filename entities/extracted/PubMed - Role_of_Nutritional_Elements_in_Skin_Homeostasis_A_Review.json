  "abstract": "Skin aging is the most prominent phenotype of human aging and is the result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Improving skin aging is essential for maintaining the normal physiological function of the skin and the mental health of the human body. Existing studies have proposed many theories of aging, such as the free radical theory, mitochondrial theory of aging, etc., and accordingly have also proposed appropriate interventions. It is worth noting that many nutrients contained in the skin itself play an important role in maintaining skin health. During the aging process, a decrease in the levels of these nutrients is closely related to a weakening of the related functions. Therefore, supplementing these nutrients offers potential therapeutic options for improving skin aging. In this review, we summarize the important roles of nutrients in the skin and their potential in anti-aging, with the expectation of providing a therapeutic basis and clinical reference for delaying skin aging.",
