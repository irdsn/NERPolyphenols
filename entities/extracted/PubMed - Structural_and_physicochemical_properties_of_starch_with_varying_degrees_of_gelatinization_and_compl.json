  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of starch gelatinization degree on the complexation mode and complexation strength of polyphenols (chlorogenic acid), as well as the changes in the physicochemical properties of potato starch with varying degrees of gelatinization before and after the addition of chlorogenic acid. The result show that the degree of gelatinization of potato starch increased from 0\u00a0% to 100\u00a0%, while the recombination rate of chlorogenic acid increased from 21.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67\u00a0% to 40.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0%. An increase in gelatinization degree enhances the interaction between chlorogenic acid and potato starch, resulting in the formation of V-type complexes. The setback value of potato starch with 100\u00a0% pasting degree decreased from 27.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.65 (\u00d7102mPa\u00a0s) to 24.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73 (\u00d7102mPa\u00a0s) after chlorogenic acid was added. The results showed that chlorogenic acid delayed the retrogradation of potato starch. The addition of chlorogenic acid enhanced the thermal stability of potato starch. The markedly bound water content (A21) of potato starch-chlorogenic acid complex gels increased from 0.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0% to 2.24\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0% as the degree of gelatinization from 0\u00a0% to 100\u00a0%, indicative of an enhanced water-holding capacity of potato starch gels by chlorogenic acid. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for expanding the use of potato starch in the food industry and improving the quality of starch-based foods.",
