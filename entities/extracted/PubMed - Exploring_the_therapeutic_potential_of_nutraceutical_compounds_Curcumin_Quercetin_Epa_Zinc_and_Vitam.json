  "abstract": "The primary treatment for Celiac disease (CeD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD), which presents challenges. Studies on the anti-inflammatory properties of Curcumin, Quercetin, Vitamin D, Zinc, and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) offer hope for patients. This study evaluated their effects on immune reactivity in gliadin-stimulated Caco-2 cells.",
