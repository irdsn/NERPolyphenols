  "abstract": "Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) oil, commonly referred to as \"Oriental olive oil,\" is renowned for its bioactive composition and associated health benefits. This review highlights its key constituents-unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, phytosterols, squalene, and vitamin E-and their therapeutic effects. Research indicates that it aids in the management of cardiovascular diseases by regulating blood lipids and blood pressure, primarily due to its oleic acid and polyphenol content. Furthermore, it exhibits neuroprotective effects in models of Alzheimer's disease, potentially by modulating communication between gut microbiota and the brain, as well as reducing neuroinflammation. Additionally,C. oleiferaoil demonstrates hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities through antioxidant pathways and immune modulation. Its benefits include mitigating liver damage, improving glycemic control, and exhibiting anticancer properties. The oil's potential to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease and acute kidney injury underscores its therapeutic versatility. Beyond its culinary applications, it is also utilized in functional foods, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics due to its antioxidant and emollient properties. This review summarizes the research on its composition, extraction methods, and health impacts, addressing existing mechanistic gaps and outlining future research directions to optimize its industrial and medical applications.",
