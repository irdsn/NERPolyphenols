  "abstract": "Quercetin (Qu), a naturally occurring flavonoid abundant in various fruits, vegetables, and grains, has garnered significant attention due to its potent antioxidant properties and wide range of functional activities, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-tumor, and neuroprotective effects. These attributes make Qu a promising candidate for extending the shelf-life of food, enhancing human health and preventing chronic diseases. However, the practical application of Qu faces challenges such as poor stability during food processing and storage, susceptibility to environmental factors, low water solubility, and poor bioavailability, which limit its effective application potential. To address these challenges, innovative Qu-based delivery systems are being developed, which protect Qu from environmental degradation and improve its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, maximizing its functional efficacy. Additionally, combinations of these delivery systems are being explored to enhance the functional activity and utilization of Qu by integrating their advantages, increasing its practical application effectiveness. This review comprehensively summarizes the challenges associated with the utilization of Qu in food and biomedicine applications and reviews advanced strategies to overcome these obstacles. It systematically introduces the structure and functional characteristics of Qu and its derivatives, discusses the instability of Qu during food processing, storage, and human digestion, and highlights environmental factors contributing to its degradation. By reviewing recent advances in Qu-based delivery systems, this review provides insights into how these technologies can enhance the stability, bioavailability, and targeted efficacy of Qu, presenting current challenges and future development prospects for more effective utilization of Qu in food safety and health-promoting applications.",
