  "abstract": "The cacao fruit is a rich source of polyphenols, including flavonoids and phenolic acids, which possess significant health benefits. The accurate identification and quantification of these bioactive compounds extracted from different parts of the cacao fruit, such as pods, beans, nibs, and cacao shells, require specific treatment conditions and analytical techniques. This review presents a comprehensive comparison of extraction processes and analytical techniques used to identify and quantify polyphenols from various parts of the cacao fruit. Additionally, it highlights the environmental impact of these methods, exploring the challenges and opportunities in selecting and utilizing extraction, analytical, and impact assessment techniques, while considering polyphenols' yield. The review aims to provide a thorough overview of the current knowledge that can guide future decisions for those seeking to obtain polyphenols from different parts of the cacao fruit.",
