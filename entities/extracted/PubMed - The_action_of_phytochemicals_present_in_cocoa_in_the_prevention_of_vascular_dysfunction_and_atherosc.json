  "abstract": "Chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), have caused many deaths worldwide. Atherosclerotic plaque formation is common in individuals with CVDs. Thus, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutritional strategies can be used to prevent or inhibit this process. Due to its higher concentrations of cocoa, dark chocolate is considered a functional food due to the presence and action of phytochemical compounds, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. However, the recommended amounts of these compounds to prevent atherosclerosis have not yet been fully elucidated.",
