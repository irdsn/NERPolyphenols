  "abstract": "Herbal medicine exhibits a broad spectrum of potent anti-cancer properties, including the enhancement of tumor immune responses, reversal of multidrug resistance, regulation of autophagy and ferroptosis, as well as anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects. This review systematically explores recent advances (primarily documented since 2019) in research on key anti-cancer compounds derived from herbal medicine, such as apigenin, artemisinin, berberine, curcumin, emodin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), ginsenosides, icariin, resveratrol, silibinin, triptolide, and ursolic acid (UA). These studies were sourced from scientific databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, and Clinical Trials. The review focuses on the significant role that these natural products play in modern oncology, exploring their efficacy, mechanisms of action, and the challenges and prospects of integrating them into conventional cancer therapies. Furthermore, it highlights cutting-edge approaches in cancer research, such as the utilization of gut microbiota, omics technologies, synthetic derivatives, and advanced drug delivery systems (DDS). This review underscores the potential of these natural products to advance the development of novel anti-cancer treatments and support contemporary medicine. Additionally, recent multi-omics findings reveal how these compounds reshape transcriptional and metabolic networks, further broadening their therapeutic scope. Many natural products exhibit synergy with first-line chemotherapies or targeted therapies, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects. Advanced nano-formulations and antibody-drug conjugates have also substantially improved their bioavailability, making them promising candidates for future translational research.",
