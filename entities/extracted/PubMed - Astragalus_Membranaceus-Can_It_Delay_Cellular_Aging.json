  "abstract": "Astragalus membranaceus, a plant that has been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, is widely regarded as one of the most valuable herbs in this medicinal tradition. It is commonly referred to as the \"yellow leader\", a designation that stems from the yellow hue of its most significant organ, the root, and its adaptogenic properties. The plant Astragalus is renowned for its abundance of active components, including polysaccharides, flavonoids, saponins, and an array of trace elements. It has been demonstrated that the administration of Astragalus can prevent cellular aging, owing to its diverse range of actions that provide protection to the body from both external and internal factors. The antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties of this plant contribute to the maintenance of good skin condition, preventing atrophy of subcutaneous tissue and degeneration of facial bones. Systemic actions encompass the maintenance of function and protection of the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, digestive, excretory, immune, and endocrine systems. This article reviews the composition ofAstragalus membranaceusand the beneficial effects of its root extract and its active substances on the whole body, with a particular focus on the anti-aging effects on the skin.",
