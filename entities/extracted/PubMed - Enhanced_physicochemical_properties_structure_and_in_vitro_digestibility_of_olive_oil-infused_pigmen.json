  "abstract": "The study investigates the composition and properties of unpopped and expanded popcorn, analyzing monosaccharides, protein, amylose, polyphenols, physical traits, crystallinity, and in vitro digestion. Unpopped grains had high glucose content (mainly from starch), which decreased by 20\u00a0% in expanded popcorn, especially in black and red A samples. Expanded grains showed higher protein levels (up to 15\u00a0%), particularly in red B and yellow samples. Amylose content ranged from 18\u00a0% to 49\u00a0%, with no clear processing trend. Polyphenol levels were generally higher in expanded popcorn, and black-blue samples exhibited the highest whiteness index (\u223c82.96). Popping reduced crystallinity (\u223c52\u00a0%), making starch more amorphous. Expanded popcorn demonstrated greater antioxidant activity (>86\u00a0%, ABTS) during oral and intestinal digestion phases, attributed to the release of bound phenolics. These results suggest pigmented popcorn expanded with EVOO could serve as a functional snack, though further research is needed to explore additional properties.",
