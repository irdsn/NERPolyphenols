  "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as crucial signaling molecules that facilitate the interactions between plants and environmental stimuli, thereby influencing a wide range of physiological and biochemical processes, such as vegetative apex development and organ morphogenesis. In response to environmental stresses, plants enhance ROS production to initiate a robust protective response. To manage excessive ROS levels, plants have developed a sophisticated antioxidative defense system comprising both enzymatic and non-enzymatic components, which work synergistically to scavenge ROS and alleviate ROS-induced deleterious effects on biomolecules. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ROS metabolism, signaling transduction pathways, and their implications for the oxidative modification of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins within plant cells.",
