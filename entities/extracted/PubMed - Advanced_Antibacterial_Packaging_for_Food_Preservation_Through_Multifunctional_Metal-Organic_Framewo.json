  "abstract": "Pathogenic microorganisms pose significant challenges in food preservation, leading to postharvest losses, economic losses, and health risks. To meet these challenges, an effective strategy is developed for antibacterial food packaging using a multifunctional metal-organic framework nanocomposite (ZIF-67@TA/CNF) composed of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), tannic acid (TA), and chitin nanofiber (CNF). The ZIF-67@TA/CNF composite is fabricated\u00a0into a biodegradable film with enhanced physicochemical properties, including superior\u00a0mechanical strength and thermal stability performance. The ZIF-67@TA/CNF film demonstrates extraordinary antibacterial activity, achieving inactivation rates of 99.63% for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, 99.89% for Escherichia coli, 99.67% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 98.83% for MDR Staphylococcus aureus. For proof of application, the ZIF-67@TA/CNF film effectively inhibits\u00a0microbial growth and\u00a0maintains\u00a0fruit integrity, extending\u00a0the shelf life for strawberry preservation. This study highlights\u00a0ZIF-67@TA/CNF as a promising\u00a0nanocomposite material for sustainable and efficient food packaging applications.",
