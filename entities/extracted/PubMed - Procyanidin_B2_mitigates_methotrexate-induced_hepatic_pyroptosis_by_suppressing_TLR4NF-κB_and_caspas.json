  "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX), a potent chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive agent, is widely used for cancer and autoimmune diseases. MTX-induced hepatotoxicity is a well-recognized adverse response, even at relatively low doses. This study investigates the possible protective effects of procyanidin B2 (PCB2) on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity. Rats were orally treated with PCB2 (40\u00a0mg/kg) for 10 days, followed by a single intraperitoneal MTX injection (20\u00a0mg/kg) on day 8. The study also included a positive control group treated with quercetin (20\u00a0mg/kg), a known antioxidant, alongside MTX. The results revealed that MTX-induced hepatic injury was evidenced by elevation in serum transaminases. This elevation was accompanied by hepatic oxidative stress due to an imbalance in oxidative/antioxidant markers, specifically elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were markedly upregulated in the liver of MTX-intoxicated rats. Additionally, the expressions of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), caspase-3 and gasdermin E (GSDME) were significantly increased in MTX rats. The use of PCB2 significantly ameliorated the deleterious effect of MTX on previous parameters by restoring oxidant/antioxidant balance, decreasing the inflammatory markers, and normalizing the expression of NF-\u03baB, TLR4, caspase-3 and GSDME. In conclusion, this study uncovered the potential role of PCB2 on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity, confirming its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyroptosis effects yet, further studies are needed to support its use as a protective therapy against such toxicity.",
