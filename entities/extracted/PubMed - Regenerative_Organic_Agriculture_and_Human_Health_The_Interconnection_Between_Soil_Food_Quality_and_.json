  "abstract": "Regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines ecological and organic principles to promote soil health, biodiversity, and long-term sustainability. This narrative review explores the connection between soil quality, food nutritional value, and human health, highlighting how ROA can enhance phytochemical content and reduce harmful residues in plant-based foods. Empirical studies report increases in vitamin C, zinc, and polyphenols in crops such as leafy greens, grapes, and carrots grown under regenerative systems, along with reductions in nitrates and pesticide residues. We summarize recent literature (2000-2025) that links soil-driven improvements in food composition to antioxidant activity and potential health benefits. By addressing current research gaps, this review supports the role of ROA in building resilient food systems and preventing chronic disease.",
