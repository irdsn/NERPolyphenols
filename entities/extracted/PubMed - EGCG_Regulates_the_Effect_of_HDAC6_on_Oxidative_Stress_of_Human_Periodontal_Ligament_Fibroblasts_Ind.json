  "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects in periodontitis. However, the specific mechanisms involved remain unclear. Our study explored whether the mechanism by which EGCG on alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLCs) involves HDAC6.",
