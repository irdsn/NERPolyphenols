  "title": "CurQ+ With Resveratrol Diminish Joint Pain in a Child With Pseudoachondroplasia: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "This case report details the successful use of over-the-counter resveratrol and CurQ+ in a five-year-old with pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH), a severe dwarfing condition caused by mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Disproportionate short stature, abnormal joints, joint deformities, and pain starting in early childhood are characteristic findings. Adult treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and joint replacement to manage joint pain. Childhood pain goes largely untreated given the concern of daily use of NSAIDs in the very young. Recently, resveratrol has been shown to reduce pain and CurQ+ improves growth in a mouse model of PSACH. The use of these over-the-counter supplements has been adopted by some families with PSACH children. One such case in this report has\u00a0a daily intake of resveratrol and CurQ+ at 125 mg of trans-resveratrol and 0.66 g, respectively, in the 16.6 kg child. This resulted in a dosage of 7.6 mg/kg of resveratrol and 40 mg/kg of CurQ+ daily. To date, no side effects from CurQ+ and resveratrol were reported in the child. Pain made walking to school very difficult (600 m) prior to the use of supplements and now the child walks to school without assistance or complaint.",
