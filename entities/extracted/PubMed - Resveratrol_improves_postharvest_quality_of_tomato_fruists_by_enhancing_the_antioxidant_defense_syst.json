  "abstract": "Resveratrol, the most widely studied phytoalexin, derived from the skin of grapes and other fruits. Evidence from numerous studies have confirmed its extensive bioactivities, such as antioxidation, anti-inflammatory and anticancer, as well as to promote antiaging effects in organisms. However, the effect of resveratrol on prolonging the postharvest storage of tomato fruits is still unknown. Here, our data provide evidence that tomato fruits applied 200\u00a0\u03bcM resveratrol displayed a significant delay in changes of weight loss, titratable acidity, soluble solids concentration, soluble\u00a0protein, vitamin C and lycopene content compared to control fruits during storage. In addition, resveratrol treatment could stimulate the antioxidant defense system to inhibit the production of ROS and down-regulate the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes. Taken together, our results suggest that resveratrol could benefit in delaying senescence and preserving the postharvest quality of tomato fruits.",
