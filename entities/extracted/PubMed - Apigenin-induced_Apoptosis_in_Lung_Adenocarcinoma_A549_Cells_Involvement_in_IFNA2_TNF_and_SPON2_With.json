  "abstract": "Apigenin, found in a variety of vegetables and fruits, exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. Recently, we reported the possibility that apigenin induces apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells through the miR-34a-5p/SNAI1/caspase-3/-7 pathway. Understanding how apigenin triggers apoptosis in cancer cells will help lay the groundwork for developing effective cancer treatments.",
