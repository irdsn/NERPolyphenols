  "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) being particularly fatal. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a key treatment for ACS; however, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) frequently occur postoperatively. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, has been proposed as an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study aims to systematically evaluate TMAO's predictive value for MACE post-PCI and explore its dose-response relationship.",
