  "abstract": "The objective of this research was to characterize the chemical composition of ethanolic extracts of the lichen speciesPlacopsis contortuplicata,Ochrolechia frigida, andUmbilicaria antarctica, their antioxidant activity, and enzymatic inhibition throughin vitroand molecular docking analysis. In total phenol content, FRAP, ORAC, and DPPH assays, the extracts showed significant antioxidant activity, and inin vitroassays for the inhibition of pancreatic lipase,\u03b1-glucosidase, and \u03b1-amylase enzymes, together within silicostudies for the prediction of pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity risks, and intermolecular interactions of compounds, the extracts evidenced inhibitory potential. A total of 13 compounds were identified by UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS inP. contortuplicata, 18 compounds inO. frigida, and 12 compounds inU. antarctica. This study contributes to the knowledge of the pool of bioactive compounds present in lichens of temperate and polar distribution and biological characteristics that increase interest in the discovery of natural products that offer alternatives for treatment studies of diseases related to oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome.",
