  "title": "Resveratrol-myosin interaction: A novel strategy for mitigating quality deterioration in frozen sturgeon surimi.",
  "abstract": "Sturgeon meat, with a lipid content nearly four times that of silver carp, is highly susceptible to lipid and protein oxidation during frozen storage, leading to quality deterioration. We selected resveratrol (RES) from 32 polyphenols and identified its efficiency for preserving sturgeon surimi during 160\u00a0days at -20\u00a0\u00b0C. RES significantly inhibited lipid and protein oxidation, reduced myofibrillar protein (MP) degradation, and stabilized \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet structures. These effects improved surimi gel quality by enhancing water retention, gel strength, hardness, and springiness. Molecular docking analysis revealed that RES interacts with sturgeon myosin through hydrophobic interactions (Arg 148, Val 158, Phe 165, His 665) and hydrogen bonds (Leu 121, Asn 161, Arg 709). RES not only competes with fatty acids for myosin binding sites, shielding proteins from oxidation, but also inhibits moisture migration, reducing ice crystal-induced damage. These findings position RES as a promising strategy for preserving high-lipid surimi products.",
