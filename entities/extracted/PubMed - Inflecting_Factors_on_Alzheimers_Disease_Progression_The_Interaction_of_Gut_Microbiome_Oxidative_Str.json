  "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurological condition caused by various factors. Diet, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota all play critical roles in the development of AD. Recent studies suggested a bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain, emphasizing the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in influencing cognitive functions. For instance, dysbiosis, a disruption in the balance of gut microbial communities, has been linked to neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, hallmark features of AD. Oxidative stress, arising from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, contributes significantly to AD pathology. The molecular mechanisms through which oxidative stress impacts neuronal health and exacerbates the cognitive decline in AD patients are also relevant. Moreover, nutritional interventions emerge as promising strategies to modulate these inflecting factors. Dietary components, such as antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols, exhibit neuroprotective effects, potentially mitigating AD progression. In contrast, the Western diet has a high potential to abet AD onset. Mediterranean diet and/or intermittent fasting are more valuable diets that may help delay the AD onset or progression. Limitations like individual differences affect the efficacy of nutritional interventions. As a supporting therapy, personalized diets should be applied according to the patients' special needs/microbiomes in the future. To gather current knowledge on the interconnected roles of the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and nutritional interventions in AD is crucial. Understanding these interactions may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches, as well as disputing the potential diets that can help improve AD patients' quality of life.",
