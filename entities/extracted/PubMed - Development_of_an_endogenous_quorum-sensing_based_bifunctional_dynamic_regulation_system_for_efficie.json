  "abstract": "Streptomyces species are known for producing a great variety of commercially valuable secondary metabolites, especially antibiotics. However, engineering ofStreptomycesis inflexible due to the lack of dynamic regulation tools. The effective endogenous quorum-sensing (QS) circuits capable of simultaneously and dynamically up- and down-regulating different sets of genes for efficient product synthesis have not yet been developed. Here, by leveraging the endogenous avenolide-mediated QS system, we designed a bifunctional dynamic regulation system in avermectin (AVE)-producing Streptomyces avermitilis, enabling simultaneous dynamic up- and down-regulation of multiple target genes. Using the dynamic up-regulation circuit, we up-regulated key genes involved in precursor supply for AVE production, resulting in a 727.4\u00a0% increase in AVE B1a (the most effective AVE component) titer in wild-type (WT) strain. Using the dynamic down-regulation circuit to down-regulate key node genes in TCA cycle, aspartate degradation, and acetate synthesis pathways for redirecting metabolic flux toward AVE production resulted in a 589.6\u00a0% increase in B1a titer in WT strain. Combined application of the dynamic up- and down-regulation circuits in WT and high-yield industrial strain A229 resulted in B1a titers 413.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (858.1\u00a0% higher than WT value) and 8067.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (25.7\u00a0% higher than A229 value). These findings present a novel bifunctional dynamic regulation strategy for strain improvement, with the potential to be easily adapted to other microorganisms with identified endogenous QS systems.",
