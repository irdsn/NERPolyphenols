  "abstract": "Dietary polyphenols represent a diverse group of plant-derived compounds known for their extensive biological activities, offering significant promise in the prevention and treatment of various chronic illnesses. Despite their potential, advancements in their research have been curtailed by challenges in structural analysis and limitations in existing research models. This review marks a pioneering exploration into how bile acids, gut microbiota, and the gut-brain axis serve as conduits through which dietary polyphenols can exert therapeutic effects on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). This review enriches understanding of their biological functions and addresses common obstacles in the study of natural polyphenols. It provides a comprehensive examination of the role of dietary polyphenols in modulating bile acid metabolism and mitigating IBD, covering aspects such as polyphenols, bile acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and the nervous system. This work opens new vistas in appreciating the full spectrum of polyphenol benefits, laying the groundwork for future explorations in this domain.",
