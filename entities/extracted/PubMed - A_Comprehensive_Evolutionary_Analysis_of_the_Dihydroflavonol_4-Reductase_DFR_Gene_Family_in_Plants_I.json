  "abstract": "Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) is a key enzyme in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway that regulates anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin accumulation in plants. AlthoughDFRgenes have been studied in various species, their origin of the DFR gene family, its distribution across the plant kingdom, and the reasons behind the emergence of different DFR subtypes Methods: This study performed a whole-genome analysis ofDFRgenes in 237 plant species, including algae, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, integrating phylogeny, conserved motifs, duplication mechanisms, positive selection, and expression pattern analyses.",
