  "abstract": "Wastewater from aquatic product processing, often laden with heavy metals like Hg\u00b2\u207a and organic waste that promotes harmful bacterial proliferation, poses substantial environmental and public health risks if left untreated. This study introduces a novel gallic acid-modified chitosan stabilized selenium nanoparticle (GA-CS@SeNPs) capable of simultaneously detecting and removing Hg\u00b2\u207a while eradicating harmful bacteria. GA-CS@SeNPs exhibit light-stimulated and light/Hg\u00b2\u207a dual-enhanced oxidase-like activity, with a remarkable adsorption capacity of 1895.8 mg g\u207b\u00b9. This nanomaterial enables rapid and ultrasensitive detection of Hg\u00b2\u207a, achieving a detection limit as low as 1.3 nM, a broad detection range (5-700 nM), and a swift response time (\u2264 1 min) under light irradiation (420 nm). Furthermore, GA-CS@SeNPs demonstrate excellent selectivity (Kd=6.0 \u00d7 10\u2075 mL g\u207b\u00b9), fast kinetics (k2=2.79\u00d710\u207b\u00b3 mg g\u207b\u00b9 min\u207b\u00b9), and a broad working pH range (4-10). In addition to its Hg\u00b2\u207a removal efficiency, the material also displays potent photocatalytic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity. This multi-functionality makes GA-CS@SeNPs a highly promising candidate for treating wastewater from aquatic product processing, offering both efficient heavy metal remediation and superior photocatalytic bacterial disinfection. The multifunctional attributes of GA-CS@SeNPs highlight its potential for future applications in environmental remediation.",
