  "title": "Synthesis of a Novel Amphiphilic Tetraphenylethylene Derivative With Aggregation-Induced Emission Characteristics for Enhanced Aged Latent Fingerprint Detection.",
  "abstract": "In the current investigation, we have devised a novel organic fluorescent compound named (2-(4-((4-vinylbenzyl)oxy)phenyl)ethene-1,1,2-triyl)tribenzene (TPE-3OH-FLA), which is built upon the framework of tetraphenylethylene luminophores. This molecule emits blue-green fluorescence upon exposure to 365-nm laser excitation, highlighting its versatile optical attributes. Furthermore, the TPE-3OH-FLA molecule exhibits the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect, confirmed through TD-DFT calculations. The successful synthesis of the TPE-3OH-FLA molecule represents a significant breakthrough in the realm of fluorescent fingerprint detection technology utilizing the soaking method. It offers a reliable and effective tool that has the potential to revolutionize forensic investigation protocols. The unique characteristics of this molecule suggest a promising role in enhancing the visibility and accuracy of latent print identification in forensic science.",
