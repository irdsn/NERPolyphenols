  "title": "Comparative Evaluation of Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Effects of Natural Compounds in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells in Relation to Their Physicochemical Properties.",
  "abstract": "The cytotoxic and apoptotic properties of four bioactive natural compounds, the prenylated \u03b1-pyronephloroglucinol heterodimer arzanol (ARZ), the methoxylated flavones eupatilin (EUP) and xanthomicrol (XAN), and the sesquiterpene zerumbone (ZER), were compared in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to assess their potential as neuroblastoma-specific therapeutics. EUP, XAN, and ZER (2.5-100 \u03bcM) exerted marked significant cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and morphological changes after 24 h of incubation, following the order XAN > ZER > EUP > ARZ (no toxic effect). The propidium iodide fluorescence assay (PI, red fluorescence) and NucView\u00ae488 assay (NV, green fluorescence) evidenced a significant increase in the apoptotic cell number, vs. controls, in SH-SY5Y cells pre-incubated for 2 h with the compounds, in the following order of apoptotic potency: XAN > EUP > ZER > ARZ. The PubChem database and freely accessible web tools SwissADME, pkCSM-pharmacokinetics, and SwissTargetPrediction were used to assess the physicochemical/pharmacokinetic properties and potential protein targets of the compounds. At 50 \u03bcM, a positive correlation (r = 0.917) between values of % viability reduction and % human intestinal absorption (bioavailability) was observed, indicating a marked contribution of compound membrane permeability to cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The capacity of compounds to induce apoptosis emerged as inversely correlated to the computed lipophilicity (r = -0.885).",
