  "abstract": "Cellular senescence has been implicated in the progression of post-traumatic osteoarthritis, but any role in pre-osteoarthritic cartilage repair is unknown. Our objective was to determine whether senescent cells contribute to fibrocartilage repair using a rodent model of marrow stimulation.",
