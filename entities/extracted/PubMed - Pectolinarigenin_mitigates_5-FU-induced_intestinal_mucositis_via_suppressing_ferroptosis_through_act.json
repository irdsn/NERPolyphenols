  "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), one of the mostly commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, frequently induces intestinal mucositis, severely impacting patient quality of life and limiting treatment efficacy. Pectolinarigenin (PEC), a bioactive compound isolated from Chinese medicinal herb Dajitan, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anticancer properties. However, its protective effect on 5-FU-induced mucositis and the underlying molecular mechanisms remains unclear.",
