  "abstract": "Cynomorium songaricum Rupr. (CSR), a perennial herb with a rich history in traditional medicine, has demonstrated therapeutic potential against metabolic syndrome (MetS) through its active compounds, including proanthocyanidins, polysaccharides, and triterpenoids. MetS, a global health concern, encompasses interlinked conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and inflammation. This review synthesizes recent findings on CSR's pharmacological and phytochemical properties, focusing on its role in ameliorating MetS.",
