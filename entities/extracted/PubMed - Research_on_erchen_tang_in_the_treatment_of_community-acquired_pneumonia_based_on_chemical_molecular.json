  "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to investigate into the effects of compounds in Erchen Tang (also known as Erchen Decoction, ECD) on the expression of inflammatory factors, as well as proteins associated with the key signaling pathways. The expression changes of proteins pertinent to those potential pathways were meticulously detected using Gene Cards, OMIM database, STRING database, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The findings indicated that both quercetin and kaempferol are highly competitive components in ECD. Additionally, these natural compounds were found to diminish the expression levels of inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Extensive research has demonstrated that quercetin and kaempferol play a pivotal role in the therapeutic efficacy of ECD for the treatment of CAP. They achieve this by exerting anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, primarily through the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway's activation. This groundbreaking discovery not only offers a novel molecular mechanism explanation for the application of Erchen Decoction in combating community-acquired pneumonia but also lays a solid theoretical foundation for the development of innovative anti-pneumonia medications that are centered around quercetin and kaempferol.",
