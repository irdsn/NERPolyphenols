  "abstract": "Free radical-induced oxidative stress contributes to the development of metabolic syndromes (Mets), including overweight, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory state. Most free radicals are generated from the mitochondrial electron transport chain; under physiological conditions, their levels are maintained by efficient antioxidant systems. A variety of transcription factors have been identified and characterized that control gene expression in response to oxidative stress status. Natural antioxidant compounds have been largely studied for their strong antioxidant capacities. This review discusses the recent progress in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Mets and highlights the anti-Mets, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory effect of polyphenols as potential nutritional therapy.",
