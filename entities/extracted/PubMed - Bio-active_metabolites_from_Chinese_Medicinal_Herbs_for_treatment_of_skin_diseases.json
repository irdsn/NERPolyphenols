  "abstract": "Skin diseases have become serious issues to human health and affect one-third of the world's population according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). These consist of internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) factors referring to genetics, hormones, and the body's immune system, as well as environmental situations, UV radiation, or environmental pollution respectively. Generally, Western Medicines (WMs) are usually treated with topical creams or strong medications for skin diseases that help superficially, and often do not treat the root cause. The relief may be instant and strong, sometimes these medicines have adverse reactions that are too strong to be able and sustained over a long period, especially steroid drug type. Chinese Medicinal Herbs (CMHs) are natural resources and relatively mild in the treatment of both manifestation and the root cause of disease. Nowadays, CMHs are attractive to many scientists, especially in studying their formulations for the treatment of skin diseases.",
