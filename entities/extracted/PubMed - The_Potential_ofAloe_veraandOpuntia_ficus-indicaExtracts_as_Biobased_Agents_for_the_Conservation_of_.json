  "abstract": "Biocorrosion, driven by microbial colonization and biofilm formation, poses a significant threat to the integrity of metal artifacts, particularly those composed of copper and its alloys.Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterial species that reduces nitrates, plays a key role in this process. This study explores the potential of two metabolite-rich plant extracts,Aloe veraandOpuntia ficus-indica, as sustainable biobased inhibitors of microbial-induced corrosion (MICOR).",
