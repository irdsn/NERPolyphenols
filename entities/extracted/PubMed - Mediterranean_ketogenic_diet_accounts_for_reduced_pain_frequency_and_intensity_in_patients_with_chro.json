  "abstract": "An increasing amount of evidence suggests that migraine is a response to cerebral energy deficiencies or oxidative stress levels that exceed antioxidant capacity. Current pharmacological options are inadequate in treating patients with chronic migraine, and a growing interest focuses on nutritional approaches as non-pharmacological treatments. The ketogenic diet, mimicking fasting that leads to an elevation of ketone bodies, is a therapeutic intervention targeting cerebral metabolism that has recently shown great promise in the prevention of migraines. Moreover, Mediterranean elements like vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices, and olive oil that are sources of anti-inflammatory elements (omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, vitamins, essential minerals, and probiotics) may create a positive brain environment by reducing imbalance in the gut microbiome.",
