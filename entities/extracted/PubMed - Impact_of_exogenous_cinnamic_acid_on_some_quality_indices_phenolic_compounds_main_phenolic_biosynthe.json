  "abstract": "Effects of postharvest trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) treatment at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3\u00a0g/L on strawberry fruit phytochemicals, quality and senescence rate during storage at 1\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0days followed by 24\u00a0h at 20\u00a0\u00b0C were studied. Treated fruit showed significantly lower senescence rate and total acids, and higher firmness (by 15, 18.5, 9.5\u00a0%), taste index (by 13, 20 and 9\u00a0%), total soluble solids, and overall quality. t-CA, at all studied concentrations, was able to significantly enhance the fruit total antioxidant activity (by 7, 11 and 9\u00a0%), total proteins (by 4.3, 3.8 and 4\u00a0%), total flavonoids (by 2.5, 5 and 5\u00a0%), total phenolics (by 9, 24 and 21\u00a0%) and total anthocyanins (by 5, 16 and 7\u00a0%) and total amino acids. The increase in different phenolic compounds content, which was negatively correlated with senescence rate, was mostly due to an increase in tyrosine ammonia-lyase activity.",
