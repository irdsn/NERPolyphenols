  "abstract": "Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid polyphenolic compound, possesses various beneficial properties such as anti-cancer, anti-aging, anti-bacterial, and antioxidant effects. It is naturally produced by many plants in response to stimulation. However, the content of resveratrol in natural plants can vary significantly, ranging from micrograms to milligrams per kilogram. As the demand for resveratrol increases, the development of methods for extracting and quantifying resveratrol in food has become a rapidly growing field in recent years. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the progress made in resveratrol analysis in food over the past decade (2012-2022), with a specific focus on the latest advancements in extraction and detection technologies. The objective is to offer a valuable reference for further research and utilization of resveratrol in various food applications.",
