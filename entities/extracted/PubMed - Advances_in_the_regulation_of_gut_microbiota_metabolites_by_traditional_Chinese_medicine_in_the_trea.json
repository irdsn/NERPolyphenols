  "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in preventing and treating diseases and improving human health. However, the complex bioactive components and regulation of signaling pathway and network restrict the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of TCM. A human being is regarded as a super \"symbiont\" composed of body cells and commensal microorganisms. Gut microbiota is the core commensal microorganism system of a human body, being considered as \"the second genome\" and the new \"organ\". Alterations in gut microbiota reflect the state of body health and progression of diseases. Recent investigations have revealed that the TCM rich in polysaccharides and polyphenols can modulate gut microbiota metabolites to rehabilitate gut homeostasis, thus ameliorating diseasesviaregulating gut-liver axis or gut-brain axis. This review summarizes the causal relationship and mechanisms of action of TCM in the treatment of diseases from the perspective of gut microbiota metabolites. Our findings are expected to provide new insights into the mechanisms of TCM in preventing and treating diseases and guidance for TCM-based drug discovery in the future.",
