  "abstract": "Excessive application of a chemical fertilizer during rice cultivation leads to soil infertility and increases production costs. An alternative way to reduce over-fertilization is to partially or fully replace the fertilizer with microbes that promote the growth and production of plants. This study aimed to investigate the Maled Phai rice cultivar (Oryza sativaL.) in a field experiment with two fungi strains.Rhizophagus variabilisKS-02 andTrichoderma zelobrevePBMP16 were selected as inocula and compared with non-R. variabilisKS-02 and non-T. zelobrevePBMP16, acting as controls, one without synthetic fertilizer and one with synthetic NPK fertilizer. The field experiment was conducted in a Randomized Complete Block design with four replications. Growth and yield parameters were determined in the plant tissues and roots, and bioactive compounds were determined in the rice seeds. The results show the presence ofT. zelobrevePBMP16 andR. variabilisKS-02 colonization in the plant roots at the harvest stage. A single inoculum of bothR. variabilisKS-02 andT. zelobrevePBMP16 significantly increased most of the plant growth performance and yield parameters, as well as the concentrations of bioactive compounds. Remarkably, such effects were more apparent than those observed with the use of a chemical fertilizer. Thus, a single inoculum ofR. variabilisKS-02 orT. zelobrevePBMP16 and the co-inoculation of both have the potential to increase the grain yield and bioactive compounds of Maled Phai under field conditions.",
