  "abstract": "Grape seed supplementation in rabbit diet on meat quality and performance was investigated. The experiment lasted 57\u00a0days and was conducted with forty Hycole rabbits 35\u00a0days-old (bodyweight: 802.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.69\u00a0g) that were randomly divided into two groups and fed either a control diet (Control group) or the same diet of the control group in which 5\u00a0% of barley and 5\u00a0% of maize were replaced with 10\u00a0% of grape seed (GS group). The dietary treatment influenced final body weight, average daily gain and dry matter intake which were higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the GS group than in the control group. The addition of 10\u00a0% grape seed in rabbit diet increased the accumulation of intramuscular fat (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), the levels of C18:1 cis-9 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and of the total monounsaturated fatty acids (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and tended to increase (P\u00a0=\u00a00.061) the sum of n-6 PUFA in meat, whereas reduced the sum of n-3 PUFA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), the levels of C22:5 n-3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and C22:6 n-3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), leading to an increase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the n-6 to n-3 ratio in GS group than in control group. Grape seed supplementation reduced TBARS values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and protected meat from lipid oxidation over time (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), demonstrating that supplementation of 10\u00a0% grape seeds in the rabbit diet could improve shelf-life in meat.",
