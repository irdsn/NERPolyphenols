  "abstract": "\u0392-glucosidase, a ubiquitous enzyme, is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of \u03b2-glycosidic linkages present in polysaccharides and contributes significantly to several industrial sectors such as food, agriculture, and biofuel production. \u03b2-glucosidases can convert polydatin to resveratrol through de-glycosylation. Resveratrol is important for human health and has potential applications in pharmacology. The preference of enzymatic conversion methods for resveratrol production improves the importance of \u03b2-glucosidases. The glucose tolerance of \u03b2-glucosidases also significantly impacts their applicability. Because the inhibition of many \u03b2-glucosidase's activity by their reaction product, glucose, is a limiting factor for industrial applications. In this study, a robust \u03b2-glucosidase was isolated from a novel-defined Jiangella ureilytica KC603 strain. The \u03b2-glucosidase encoding gene (JurBglKC603) was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and a 50.1\u00a0kDa protein was purified using Ni-affinity column chromatography. The efficient polydatin deglycosylation capacity of JurBglKC603 was determined by Glucose Oxidase-Peroxidase (GOPOD) assay. JurBglKC603 exhibits remarkable resistance to glucose concentrations of up to 3\u00a0M. The enzyme remained active across a broad pH spectrum and was unaffected by most heavy metal ions, except for Hg2+. The kinetic parameters of JurBglKC603 were Km=\u20090.44\u00a0mM, Vmax=\u200926.87 U\u00b7mg-1, kcat=\u200921.1\u00a0s-1, and kcat/Km=\u200947,954\u00a0M-1\u00b7s-1against pNPG and Km=\u20094.6\u00a0mM, Vmax=\u200920 U\u00b7mg-1, kcat=\u200917.2\u00a0s-1, and kcat/Km=\u20093822\u00a0M-1\u00b7s-1against polydatin. Molecular docking studies have demonstrated that Gln19, His120, Trp411, and Glu410 play a vital role in the interaction with polydatin.",
