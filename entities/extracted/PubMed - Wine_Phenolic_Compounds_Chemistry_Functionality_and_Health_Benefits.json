  "abstract": "Wine phenolic compounds, often known as polyphenols, are a diverse group of secondary bioactive compounds derived from grapes. They play a crucial role in defining the sensory characteristics, functionality, and health benefits of wine. This review explores the complex chemistry of these compounds, focusing on key classes such as flavonoids, which include flavanones, flavonols, anthocyanins, and flavan-3-ols, and non-flavonoids, such as hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and stilbenes. The health benefits of wine phenolics, particularly their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, are also discussed in relation to preventing and reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, this review summarized the most current data from human population-based research that investigated the bioactivity of these red wine phytochemicals with relevant health benefits for NCDs. Finally, this review proposes some perspectives for future research to better understand the bioavailability, metabolism, and long-term health effects of these compounds.",
