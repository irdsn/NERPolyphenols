  "abstract": "Growing consumer awareness encourages food producers to look for new fortifying additives for muffins. One such additive may be the polysaccharide fraction residue after starch isolation from unripe apples, as they are a source of many bioactive compounds. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of the addition of the polysaccharide fraction residue from unripe apples on the quality and physical properties as well as health-promoting properties of muffins. It was observed that the polysaccharide fraction residue from unripe apples did not deteriorate the texture or volume of muffins and contributed to an increase in the content of polyphenols, and the antioxidant potential of muffins, especially the polysaccharide residue from unripe apples of the Oliwka variety, had a more beneficial effect on the above-mentioned features of muffin than Pyros. Moreover, it was observed that the content of phytosterols (campesterol and cleosterol) in muffins increases but the content of tocopherols decreases due to their thermolability during the baking process.",
