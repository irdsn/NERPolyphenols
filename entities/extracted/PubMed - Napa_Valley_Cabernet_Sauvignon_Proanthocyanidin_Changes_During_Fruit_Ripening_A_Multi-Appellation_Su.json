  "abstract": "In 2015, an experiment was designed to investigate the distribution and variance of in winegrape flavonoids across the ripening phase in the Napa Valley. This Cabernet Sauvignon experiment was intended to evaluate the polyphenol differences across Napa Valley in order to understand parameters controlling \"proanthocyanidin activity.\" This method has shown promise in understanding proanthocyanidin (PA) astringency based on size distribution, pigmentation, conformation, and composition. Results from whole berry partial extractions showed that seed PA material was driving PA activity early in the ripening phase, while the formation of the pigmented polymer led to a decrease later in the growing season. Multivariate analysis showed that the main drivers of changes across the ripening phase were the molecular masses of PAs and the amount of pigmentation. Given the high amount of variability seen in the experiment between sites in such a small geographical area, the results suggest that manipulation of PA activity may be possible in the vineyard, perhaps explaining variations in wine mouthfeel attributes between locations. These results can be used to develop furthermore controlled experiments targeting the variables responsible for PA activity changes.",
