  "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) exhibits significant antioxidant properties, can effectively protect the human body from free radical damage and thereby maintain normal physiological and immune functions. However, its application is constrained by poor stability and susceptibility to oxidation. Protein modified chitosan (CS)-based nano-delivery systems have been widely used for protecting food functional components against complex external environmental factors. Herein, black fish skin protein (FSP) was successfully extracted and utilized as a stabilizer for constructing chitosan-based nano-delivery system loaded with RA. Specifically, polyphenol-protein-polysaccharide three-phase hybrid nano-complexes (RA@FSP/CS NCs) were prepared using a pH-driven strategy assisted by ultrasonic treatment. The preparation process of RA@FSP/CS NCs was optimized by the particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and antioxidant activity, obtained that the optimal mass ratio of FSP to CS was 2:3. RA@FSP/CS23NCs showed spherical microstructure, effectively protected and maintained the antioxidant activity of RA, and owed excellent stability, good biocompatibility, and sustained-release performance.",
