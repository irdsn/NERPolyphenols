  "abstract": "Agricultural research with respect to studying the effects of genetic background and environmental conditions on plant and commercial parameters is ample. Nevertheless, data on the effects on nutritional value and phytonutritional composition are scarce, despite its significance to the consumer, as well as its importance in providing nutritional security. The present study aimed to simplify, unify and make accessible a set of spectrophotometric nutritional assessment assays, comprising a valuable tool in agricultural research. Efforts were made to provide simple, rapid, small-scale and cost-effective protocols, aiming to minimize resources and time, learning-curve and erring.",
