  "abstract": "Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a cell therapy originally employed for cutaneous T cell lymphoma and later for GvHD, solid organ rejection and other immunological diseases demonstrating an excellent safety profile. Mononuclear cell (MNCs) apoptosis triggered by UV-A light irradiation in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralene has a key role in priming the cells, ultimately leading to immunomodulation. We report preliminary data about an evaluation of the new automated irradiator device LUMILIGHT (Pelham Crescent srl) for off-line ECP. Fifteen MNCs samples collected by apheresis from 15 adult patients undergoing ECP at our Center were cultured immediately after irradiation along with untreated samples and evaluated at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h timepoints for T cell apoptosis and viability by flow cytometry with Annexin V and Propide Iodidum staining. Post irradiation Hematocrit (HCT), calculated by the device, was compared with that of the automated cell counter. Bacterial contamination was also tested. In irradiated samples after 24-48 and 72\u00a0h, the average total apoptosis was 47 %, 70 % and 82 %, respectively, showing a significant difference from untreated samples; residual viable lymphocytes at 72\u00a0h were, on average, 18 %. The greatest initiation of apoptosis occurred from 48\u00a0h of irradiation onwards. Average early apoptosis of irradiated samples decreased over time (26 %, 17 % and 10 % at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h, respectively). HCT measured by LUMILIGHT was over-estimated, possibly due to the low pre irradiation red blood cell contamination. Bacterial tests resulted negative. Our study showed the LUMILIGHT device to be a valid instrument for MNCs irradiation with good handling and no major technical problems as well as no adverse events in the patients. Our data need to be confirmed in larger studies.",
