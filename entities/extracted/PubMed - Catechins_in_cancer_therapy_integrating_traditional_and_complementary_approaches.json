  "abstract": "Catechin is a group of bioactive flavonoids found in various plant sources such as tea, cocoa, and fruits. Recent studies have suggested that catechins has significant potential in preventing and treating cancer. Catechin exhibits a variety of biological activities that may contribute to its anticancer effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic properties. Studies have demonstrated that catechin can inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis across multiple cancer types, including skin, breast, lung, liver, prostate, and colon cancers. Furthermore, catechin has shown the ability to inhibit angiogenesis, a critical process for tumor growth and metastasis, by restricting new blood vessel formation. Catechin's impact on cancer extends beyond its direct effects on cancer cells. It modulates various signaling pathways involved in cancer progression, such as those associated with cell survival, inflammation, and metastasis. Despite these promising findings, additional research is needed to clarify the precise mechanisms of catechin's anticancer action, optimal dosing strategies, and long-term safety in cancer prevention and treatment. This review will explore the current research landscape on tea polyphenols, particularly catechin, and their potential role in cancer prevention and therapy.",
