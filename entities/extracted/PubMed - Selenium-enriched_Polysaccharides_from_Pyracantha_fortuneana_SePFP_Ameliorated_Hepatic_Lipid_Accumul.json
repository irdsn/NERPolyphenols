  "abstract": "Selenium-enriched polysaccharides from Pyracantha fortuneana (SePFP) has many beneficial physiological activities, but how it improves the aging associated abnormal lipid metabolism is still unclear. Therefore, we explored the mechanisms of the regulatory role of SePFP on liver lipid accumulation in aging mice.",
