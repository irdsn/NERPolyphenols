  "abstract": "The food products derived fromOlea europaeaare a fundamental part of the Mediterranean diet, and their health-promoting effects are well known. In this study, we analyzed the phytochemical characteristics, the redox state modulatory activity, and the cytotoxic effect of an olive leaf aqueous extract enriched by macroporous resin on different tumor and normal cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, HFF-1). HPLC-DAD analysis, the Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride methods confirmed the qualitatively and quantitatively high content of phenolic compounds (130.02 \u00b1 2.3 mg GAE/g extract), and a DPPH assay (IC50= 100.00 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcg/mL), the related antioxidant activity. The biological investigation showed a significant cytotoxic effect, highlighted by an MTT test and the evident cellular morphological changes, on two prostate cancer cell lines. Remarkably, the extract was practically non-toxic on HFF-1 at the concentrations (100, 150, 300 \u00b5g/mL) and exposure times tested. Hence, the results are selective for tumor cells. The underlying cytotoxicity was associated with the decrease in ROS production (55% PC3, 42% LNCaP) and the increase in RSH levels (>50% PC3) and an LDH release assay (50% PC3, 40% LNCaP, established necrosis as the main cell death mechanism.",
