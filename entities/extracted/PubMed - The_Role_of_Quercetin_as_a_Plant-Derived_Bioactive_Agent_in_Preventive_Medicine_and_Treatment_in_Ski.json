  "title": "The Role of Quercetin as a Plant-Derived Bioactive Agent in Preventive Medicine and Treatment in Skin Disorders.",
  "abstract": "Quercetin, a bioactive plant flavonoid, is an antioxidant, and as such it exhibits numerous beneficial properties including anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antibacterial and antiviral activity. It occurs naturally in fruit and vegetables such as apples, blueberries, cranberries, lettuce, and is present in plant waste such as onion peel or grape pomace which constitute good sources of quercetin for technological or pharmaceutical purposes. The presented study focuses on the role of quercetin in prevention and treatment of dermatological diseases analyzing its effect at a molecular level, its signal transduction and metabolism. Presented aspects of quercetin potential for skin treatment include protection against aging and UV radiation, stimulation of wound healing, reduction in melanogenesis, and prevention of skin oxidation. The article discusses quercetin sources (plant waste products included), methods of its medical administration, and perspectives for its further use in dermatology and diet therapy.",
