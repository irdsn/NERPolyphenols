  "abstract": "This study aimed to design an innovative antioxidant and antibacterial film for functional and health-promoting food packaging materials using food-grade polysaccharides incorporated with polyphenol-rich roselle leaf extracts (RLE). The films were fabricated using the casting method of pectin (P), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC), and RLE. Six sets of films; 3 control films such as pectin (P-0), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC-0), pectin plus carboxymethyl chitosan (PCMC-0), and 3 treated films such as pectin (PR-3), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCR-3), (PCMCR-3) with 3\u00a0% RLE were prepared respectively to study the effects of RLE on the properties and function of prepared films. The water vapor permeability of the films ranged from 4.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0g\u00a0mm/h\u00b7m2\u00b7kPa to 6.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0g\u00a0mm/h\u00b7m2\u00b7kPa, with RLE-incorporated samples exhibiting lower permeability than the control sample. The maximum tensile strength (53.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.07\u00a0MPa) and elongation of break (85.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.81\u00a0%) were observed at PCMCR-3 containing 3\u00a0% RLE. The highest water contact angle (109.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16) was also noted in the PCMCR-3 film. The incorporation of RLE decreased the roughness of the film microstructure. The addition of RLE film CMC-R and PCMCR-3 notably enhanced the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of the edible film. Overall, the PCMCR-3 films extended the shelf life of fresh fish preserved at 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C, offering promising innovative food preservation packaging materials for preserving perishable food products.",
