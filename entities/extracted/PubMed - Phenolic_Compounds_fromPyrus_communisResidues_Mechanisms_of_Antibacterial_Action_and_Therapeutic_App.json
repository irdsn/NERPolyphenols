  "abstract": "The food industry produces substantial amounts of fruit byproducts, which are often discarded despite their high content of bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic applications.Pyrus communis(pear) residues, which are particularly rich in phenolic compounds, represent a valuable yet underutilized resource. These byproducts have demonstrated significant antioxidant and antibacterial properties, suggesting their potential for medical and pharmaceutical applications. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenolic profile ofP. communisbyproducts, emphasizing their antioxidant and antibacterial mechanisms and their prospective use in combating oxidative stress and antibacterial resistance.",
