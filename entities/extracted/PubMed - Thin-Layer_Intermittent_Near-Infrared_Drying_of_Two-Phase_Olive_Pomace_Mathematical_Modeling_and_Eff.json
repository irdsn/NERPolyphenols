  "abstract": "The present study examined the drying kinetics of two-phase olive pomace (OP) using near-infrared (NIR) thin layer intermittent drying at 70-140 \u00b0C. For the first time, this approach was combined with color, bioactive compound retention and antioxidant activity assessment. Among tested models, the Midilli's semi-empirical model best described the drying behavior (r2\u2265 0.99839, RMSE \u2264 0.01349). Effective diffusivity ranged from 1.417 \u00d7 10-9to 5.807 \u00d7 10-9m2/s, and activation energy was calculated at 23.732 kJ/mol. Drying at 140 \u00b0C reduced time by 68% compared to 70 \u00b0C. The corresponding sample had the highest total phenolics content, antioxidant activity (DPPH\u25cf, CUPRAC assays) and triterpenic acid (maslinic, oleanolic) content, and a significant amount of hydroxytyrosol, despite the increased sample browning. Compared to oven-drying (140 \u00b0C), NIR was equal or better and 3.2-fold faster. The same was evidenced compared to freeze-drying, except for tyrosol recovery (1.2-fold lower in NIR). These findings were obtained using two different OP industrial samples. Given that NIR is already used industrially for food drying, the present study offers proof-of-concept for its application as a rapid and eco-friendly pretreatment of OP for food and feed uses. However, scalability challenges and the limitations of semi-empirical modeling must be addressed in the future to support industrial-scale implementation.",
