  "title": "Four novel alkaloids from Aspergillus fumigatus and their antimicrobial activities.",
  "abstract": "Systematic chemical analysis of endophytic fungal Aspergillus fumigatus secondary metabolites enabled the isolation of four novel alkaloids, asperfumines A-D (1-4), in addition to fourteen previously documented compounds (5-18). The new compounds were structurally characterized using various spectroscopic means such as UV, IR, HRESIMS, and 1D/2D NMR. The stereoconfigurations of the novel compounds were elucidated using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of the obtained compounds was assessed. Among them, compounds 17 and 18 displayed moderate inhibitory effects against selected microbial strains, with 18 exhibiting notable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC\u00a0=\u00a03.12\u00a0\u03bcg/mL).",
