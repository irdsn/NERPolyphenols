  "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition characterized by neurochemical imbalances and behavioral disruptions. Emerging evidence suggests that quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, may possess neuroprotective properties. This study investigates the potential effects of quercetin on neurochemical dynamics associated with single prolonged stress (SPS)-induced PTSD in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the SPS protocol to induce PTSD-like symptoms. Following SPS exposure, rats were randomly assigned to either a quercetin treatment group or a vehicle control group. Neurochemical analysis was performed post-treatment, including assessment of neurotransmitter concentrations (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) and inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) in relevant brain tissues. Behavioral assessments were also conducted to correlate neurochemical changes with PTSD-like symptoms. Preliminary findings suggest that quercetin treatment, particularly at 20\u00a0mg/kg dosages, resulted in a partial modulation of neurochemical dysregulation related to PTSD. Specifically, quercetin administration attenuated the stress-induced regional alterations in neurotransmitter levels, including increased dopamine and serotonin levels, and decreased markers of neuroinflammation in the studied brain regions compared to the control group. These changes were associated with improvements in anxiety-like and depressive behavior alongside increased cognitive performance. Quercetin shows potential to improve the neurochemical imbalances linked to PTSD in a rat model. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and investigate the exact mechanisms of action, as well as the therapeutic potential of quercetin for individuals with PTSD.",
