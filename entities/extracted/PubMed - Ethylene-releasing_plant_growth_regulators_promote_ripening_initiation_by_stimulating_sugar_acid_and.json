  "abstract": "Fruit ripening is a coordinated process that leads to an increase in sugars, decrease in acids and accumulation of pigments. Blueberry fruit exhibit an atypical climacteric ripening behavior. These fruit display an increase in respiration and ethylene production during ripening, however ethylene synthesis is developmentally regulated. In this study, the effect of ethylene on blueberry fruit ripening was investigated via preharvest applications of ethylene-releasing plant growth regulators (PGRs), ethephon and 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC), in one southern highbush cultivar, Miss Lilly in 2019, and two rabbiteye cultivars, Premier and Powderblue in 2019 and 2020. Further, the effects of these two PGRs on fruit metabolism during ripening in the two rabbiteye cultivars, and postharvest fruit quality in all three cultivars were evaluated.",
