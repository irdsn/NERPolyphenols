  "abstract": "The presence of 19 polyphenolic compounds were evaluated through the mass spectrometric analysis of the hot water extracts of the poroid mushroomPhylloporia pectinata(Klotzsch) Ryvarden. Among these, Phelligridin D stood as the principle polyphenolic entity within the poroid mushroom under examination. The total phenolic content inPhylloporia pectinatawas assessed, taking into account the tannin acid equivalents (TAE). To evaluate the antioxidant efficacy, various radical scavenging assays including hydroxyl, superoxide, and 2,2-diphenyl 1-1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were considered using different solvent extracts prepared from the powdered basidiocarps. Maximum TAE (24.75\u2009mg/g) were found in hot water (HW) extract, which was obtained for 1.5\u2009h of extraction, significantly surpassing the results obtained from the ethanolic (1.66\u2009mg/g) and methanolic (2.64\u2009mg/g) extracts. The study was further reinforced by the remarkable antioxidant potential of the HW extract, evidenced by high hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (94.05%), superoxide radical scavenging activity (90.8%), and DPPH radical scavenging activity (76.2%) obtained for 1.5\u2009h. This prominence was substantiated through high-performance liquid chromatography analysis (HPLC), underscoring its significant contribution towards the oxidative defence mechanism.",
