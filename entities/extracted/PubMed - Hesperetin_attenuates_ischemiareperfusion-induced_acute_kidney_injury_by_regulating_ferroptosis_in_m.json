  "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex syndrome often resulting from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (IRI). Due to the significant role of ferroptosis in AKI pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis could offer potential benefits in managing AKI. Hesperetin, has shown potential in inhibiting ferroptosis-related pathways, while its role in I/R-induced AKI remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the renoprotective effects of hesperetin on IRI mice and further investigate its underlying molecular mechanism related to ferroptosis.",
