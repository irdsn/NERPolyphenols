  "abstract": "Background/Objectives:Zingiber officinaleRoscoe (Zingiberaceae) is widely recognized for its diverse biological activities; however, the stability and bioavailability of its bioactive compounds remain significant challenges. This study aimed to investigate an innovative approach to enhance the stability and efficacy ofZ. officinalephytoconstituents through advanced encapsulation techniques.Methods: Two novel carrier systems were developed: (i) direct micro-spray encapsulation ofZ. officinalein maltodextrin (MZO) and (ii) a two-step process involving the creation of a kaolinite-based phytocarrier system (ZO-kaolinite), followed by micro-spray encapsulation in maltodextrin to form the MZO-kaolinite system.Results: Comprehensive chemical profiling using GC-MS and ESI-QTOF-MS identified 105 phytochemicals, including terpenoids, gingerols, shogaols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Morphostructural analyses (XRD, FTIR, Raman, SEM) confirmed the successful development of the newly engineered kaolinite carrier systems (ZO-kaolinite and MZO-kaolinite systems). Both the ZO-kaolinite and MZO-kaolinite systems exhibited superior antioxidant activity, potent antimicrobial efficacy against major bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus,Enterococcus faecalis,Bacillus cereus,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Escherichia coli), and enhanced cytotoxicity against MCF-7, HCT-116, and HeLa cancer cell lines.Conclusions: This study underscores the synergistic action of kaolinite and maltodextrin in developing multifunctional therapeutic systems, emphasizing the importance of phytoconstituent stabilization and nanotechnology in addressing antimicrobial resistance and advancing innovative medical applications.",
