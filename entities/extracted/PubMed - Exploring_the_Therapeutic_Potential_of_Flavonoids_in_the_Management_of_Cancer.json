  "abstract": "Flavonoids are a class of polyphenolic compounds that can be classified into six distinct categories, namely isoflavonoids, flavanones, flavanols, flavonols, flavones, and anthocyanidins. These compounds are naturally occurring and can be found in a diverse range of plant species. Flavonoids, a class of bioactive compounds, are mostly obtained through the consumption of vegetables, fruits and plant-derived beverages such as wine, cocoa-based products and green tea. Flavonoids have been demonstrated to exhibit a diverse range of anticancer properties. These include the modulation of activities of enzymes involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species, involvement in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and autophagy, as well as suppression of cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. Flavonoids exhibit a dual role in maintaining reactive oxygen species balance. They function as antioxidants in regular physiological conditions, while also demonstrating significant pro-oxidant properties in cancer cells. This prooxidant activity induces apoptotic pathways and downregulates pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. The paper explores the biochemical characteristics, bioavailability, anticancer efficacy, and modes of action of flavonoids.",
