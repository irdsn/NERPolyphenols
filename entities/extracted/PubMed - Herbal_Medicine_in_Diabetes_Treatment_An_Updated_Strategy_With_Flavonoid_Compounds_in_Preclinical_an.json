  "abstract": "Diabetes is a complex and increasingly prevalent condition, affecting a significant portion of the global population and associated with multiple risk factors. Managing the disease remains a significant challenge, especially with the risks and severe side effects of current treatments, underscoring the need for safer and more effective therapies. Natural sources, particularly flavonoids, have shown considerable promise in reducing blood glucose levels. Flavonoids, a diverse group of bioactive compounds found in various medicinal plants, have demonstrated potent antidiabetic properties. Notable flavonoids, such as apigenin, arbutin, catechins, and cyanidin, have been shown to lower blood glucose and enhance insulin secretion. Their clinical effectiveness is attributed to their ability to regulate metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal several mechanisms of action at the molecular, cellular, and subcellular levels, including the activation of glycolytic pathways and the inhibition of glucose synthesis and storage. This review provides an overview of the clinical potential of flavonoids in diabetes management, detailing their molecular mechanisms of action. Although flavonoids show promising results in reducing fasting blood glucose levels, most human studies have been short-term supplementation trials and lack long-term safety data and evidence for sustained glucose regulation. As research progresses, further comprehensive studies are essential to validate the efficacy, safety, and long-term benefits of flavonoids and other herbal compounds as viable treatments for diabetes.",
