  "abstract": "Black tea is vital for superior gel properties in preserved eggs, but the standardized usage guidelines are lacking due to limited understanding of its role in preserved egg white (PEW) formation. Thus, this study investigates the impact of black tea on gel properties of PEW and elucidates the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our findings reveal that black tea significantly improves PEW gel properties, with optimal effects at 1\u00a0% concentration. The reinforcement mechanism involves: (1) covalent interactions between black tea polyphenols (BTPs) and egg white proteins (EWPs) under alkaline conditions, promoting protein aggregation through increased \u03b2-sheet content and disulfide bonds; and (2) enhanced free metal ion concentration and uniform distribution in the curing solution, strengthening the \"pore-blocking effect\", thus further prevent the liquefaction of PEW gel. These findings provide a theoretical basis for optimizing preserved egg processing and highlight black tea's multifunctional role in improving gel properties.",
