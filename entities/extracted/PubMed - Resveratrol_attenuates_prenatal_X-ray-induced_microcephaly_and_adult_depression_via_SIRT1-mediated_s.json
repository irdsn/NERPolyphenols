  "abstract": "With increasing use of medical imaging (e.g., CT scans) and environmental radiation sources, over 2 % of pregnancies worldwide are inadvertently exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (IR), raising urgent concerns about fetal neuroprotection. While prenatal IR is implicated in microcephaly and lifelong neuropsychiatric risks, prior studies have not resolved whether sirtuin-mediated pathways, particularly SIRT1/TPH2 signaling, drive these deficits or whether dietary phytochemicals like resveratrol can mitigate them.",
