  "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis is used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of diseases. Schisandra chinensis lignans (SCL) are one of the most active components extracted from Schisandrae chinensis fructus, exhibit a broad array of pharmacological properties, especially anti-inflammatory and hepatic lipid-lowering effects, suggesting SCL may have potential anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) ability. However, the therapeutic efficacy of SCL against NASH and the underlying mechanism of this action remains unclear.",
