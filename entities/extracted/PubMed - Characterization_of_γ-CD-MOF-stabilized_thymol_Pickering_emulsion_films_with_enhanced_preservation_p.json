  "abstract": "Maintaining the freshness of perishable foods, especially seafood, is a major challenge due to rapid spoilage. This study developed active packaging films by incorporating thymol-loaded Pickering emulsions stabilized by \u03b3-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (\u03b3-CD-MOF) into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The films were characterized for their physical, mechanical, and barrier properties. FTIR, XRD, and thermal analysis confirmed successful incorporation and good stability. The films exhibited antimicrobial activity against foodborne bacteria. When applied to Basa fish fillets at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the films reduced bacterial counts from 9.87 to 6.1 log CFU/g over 18\u00a0days and extended shelf life by 6\u00a0days. Chemical stability improvements were observed through changes in pH, TBARS, and TVB-N levels. This research offers a promising approach to addressing food spoilage challenges and provides a potential solution for extending the shelf life of highly perishable seafood products through advanced active packaging technology.",
