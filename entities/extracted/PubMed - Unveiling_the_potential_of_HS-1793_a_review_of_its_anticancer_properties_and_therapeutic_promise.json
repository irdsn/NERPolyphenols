  "abstract": "HS-1793 is a novel derivative of resveratrol, a compound known for its numerous beneficial effects, including anticancer activity, anti-inflammatory response, antimicrobial, antiaging, anti-cardiovascular disease activity, neuroprotective activity, etc. Despite its wide and interesting properties, resveratrol suffers from a crucial flaw because it is low bioavailable. For this reason, many other derivatives were explored and among them, HS-1793 has caught the attention of researchers. HS-1793 is a synthetic derivative of resveratrol discovered in 2007 that has been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the compound showed a positive profile in metabolic processes, with adequate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This review highlights current research on HS-1793, evaluatingin vitroandin vivoworks and lays the foundation for novel explorative trials in human diseases.",
