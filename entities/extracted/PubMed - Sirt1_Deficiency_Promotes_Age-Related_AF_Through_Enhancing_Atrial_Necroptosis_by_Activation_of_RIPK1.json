  "abstract": "Aging is one of the most potent risk determinants for the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF). Sirts (sirtuins) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and their expression declines with aging. However, whether Sirts involved in age-related AF and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The present study aims to explore the role of Sirts in age-related AF and delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms.",
