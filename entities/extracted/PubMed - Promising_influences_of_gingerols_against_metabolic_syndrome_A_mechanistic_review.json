  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is an inflammatory disorder characterized by diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Globally, this disease is increasing, especially in developed countries. Supposedly, herbal treatments for this disease likely have fewer adverse effects than chemical medications. Thus, they can be suitable options among the available chemical treatments. Ginger has been used as a spice and medicinal plant in traditional medicine and cooking. This herbal compound and its derivatives, such as 6-gingerol, have shown promising effects on various molecular aspects of metabolic syndrome. In this study, we reviewed and discussed the significant impacts of gingerol, a derivative of ginger, on metabolic syndrome through various mechanisms. The benefits of 6-gingerol include its effects on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which prevent diabetes, lipid regulating effect (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, PPARs), as well as its effects on enzymes and proteins preventing hyperlipidemia caused by a high-fat diet. In addition, 6-gingerol has anti-atherosclerosis and anti-hypertension effects through several molecular mechanisms. The current review will discuss various effects of 6-gingerol on molecular pathways involved in diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and hypertension as characterizing features of metabolic syndrome and suggests that 6-gingerol can be a potential treatment agent for metabolic syndrome and shed light on a higher requirement for more pre-clinical and clinical investigations.",
