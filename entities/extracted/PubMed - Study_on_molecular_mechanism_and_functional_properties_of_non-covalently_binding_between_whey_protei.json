  "abstract": "This study investigated non-covalent conjugation of chlorogenic acid (CGA) with three whey proteins. Structural modifications were characterized through spectroscopic analyses, while functional properties were assessed by evaluating antioxidant capacity, bio-accessibility, and taste profiles. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated interaction mechanisms. FTIR analysis revealed CGA-induced secondary structure alterations: \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-La) exhibited increased \u03b2-sheet content (10.64\u00a0%) with decreased \u03b2-turn (8.41\u00a0%), indicating structural compaction. Conversely, \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-Lg) showed reduced \u03b1-helix (8.54\u00a0%) and \u03b2-sheet (10.61\u00a0%) contents but increased \u03b2-turn (10.09\u00a0%) and random coil (7.55\u00a0%), suggesting structural destabilization. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) demonstrated the most pronounced structural disorder. Fluorescence and UV spectra indicated stronger static quenching of \u03b2-Lg by CGA compared to \u03b1-La. Molecular dynamics confirmed stable CGA binding to all three proteins. CGA conjugation significantly enhanced the proteins' antioxidant activities. Notably, CGA bioaccessibility improved by 29.72\u00a0%, 30.43\u00a0%, and 16.81\u00a0% when complexed with \u03b1-La, \u03b2-Lg, and GMP, respectively. Additionally, astringency was reduced through competitive inhibition of CGA-salivary protein interactions.",
