  "abstract": "(Poly)phenols are a wide and heterogeneous class of substances with several potential health benefits. Their role in neuroprotection and cognition is still questionable. This study's scope is to examine the possible association between total and individual (poly)phenol intake, major dietary sources, and the severity of multiple sclerosis (MS) in a cohort of MS patients. Participants' demographics, physical activity, smoking, and dietary information were collected, alongside clinical parameters including the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), MS phenotype, and current therapy. A validated 110-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess participants' habits. The (poly)phenol content of foods was estimated using the Phenol-Explorer database. Data from 106 participants were analyzed. A high intake of vegetables was associated with a 4.6-fold higher probability of mild MS (95% CI: 1.49, 14.28), whereas no association was found for other food and beverage sources. Hydroxycinnamic acids were significantly related to MSSS (OR: 6.55, 95% CI: 2.15, 19.92). Although coffee intake differed significantly between patients with mild and severe MS (90.5 \u00b1 53.9 vs. 59.4 \u00b1 40.8 mL/d, respectively), linear regression analysis did not confirm an association with MSSS. A higher intake of hydroxycinnamic acids and vegetables may impact MS severity. Coffee's role remains unclear and needs to be further investigated.",
