  "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of bacterial infections and the rise in antibiotic resistance have prompted the search for alternative therapeutic strategies. One promising approach involves combining plant-based bioactive substances with nanoparticles, which have demonstrated improved antimicrobial activity compared to their free forms, both in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical studies. This approach not only improves their stability but also enables targeted delivery to bacterial cells, reducing side effects and minimising the risk of resistance development, leading to more effective treatments. This narrative review explores the benefits of combining bioactive plant compounds (berberine, catechin, chelerythrine, cinnamaldehyde, ellagic acid, proanthocyanidin, and sanguinarine) with nanoparticles for the treatment of bacterial infections (caused byStaphylococcus aureus,Enterococcusspp.,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Acinetobacter baumannii,Escherichia coli,Serratia marcescens, andPseudomonas aeruginosa), highlighting the potential of this approach to overcome the limitations of traditional antimicrobial therapies. Ultimately, this strategy offers a promising alternative in the fight against resistant bacterial strains, paving the way for the development of more effective and sustainable treatments.",
