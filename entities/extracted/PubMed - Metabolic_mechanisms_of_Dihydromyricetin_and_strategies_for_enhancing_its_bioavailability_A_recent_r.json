  "title": "Metabolic mechanisms of Dihydromyricetin and strategies for enhancing its bioavailability: A recent review.",
  "abstract": "Dihydromyricetin, a flavonoid primarily found in vine tea, offers a range of health-promoting benefits, making it a promising functional food ingredient for improving nutrition and preventing diseases. However, its limited solubility, unstable physicochemical properties, short half-life, and rapid metabolism contribute to poor bioavailability, which restricts its broader application in food, pharmaceutical, and related industries. To overcome these challenges, extensive research has focused on strategies to enhance the bioavailability of dihydromyricetin. This paper reviews the digestion, absorption, tissue distribution, and metabolic mechanisms of dihydromyricetin in the human body. It examines the key factors influencing its bioavailability and highlights the design and construction of various bio-based delivery systems aimed at improving its bioavailability. Furthermore, the paper explores the potential applications of these delivery systems. The development of such systems can significantly enhance the stability and bioavailability of dihydromyricetin, providing a solid theoretical foundation for advancing its use in food and medicine.",
