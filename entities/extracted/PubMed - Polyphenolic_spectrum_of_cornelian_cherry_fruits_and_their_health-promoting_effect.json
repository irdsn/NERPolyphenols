  "abstract": "Although cornelian cherry is an underutilized fruit species, its fruits have a high biological value due to valuable biologically active substances, especially polyphenols. The total content of polyphenols accounts for 37% of all the bioactive substances examined. Flavonols, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids represent the main groups of phenolic compounds present and thanks to these compounds, cornelian cherry fruits possess mainly antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, metabolic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and anticancer effects. This review summarizes new research aimed at popularizing this lesser-known species not only for direct consumption but also for further processing.",
