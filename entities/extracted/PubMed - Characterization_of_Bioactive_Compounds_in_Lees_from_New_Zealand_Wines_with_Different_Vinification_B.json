  "abstract": "Wine lees are one of the main by-products produced during winemaking. Little is known about the effect of the vinification technique on the phenolic compounds and the biological activity of wine lees extracts. Wine lees collected at varying vinification sources of two grape varieties, Riesling (RL) and Pinot Noir (PN), were analyzed for total phenolic content (TPC), tannin content (TTC), their anthocyanin and phenolic profile, and the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of their extracts. The results showed a low TPC and TTC in RL lees, which could be attributed to the varietal characteristic of RL grapes and to less skin contact during vinification. Vinification techniques modified the composition of the phenolic compounds in the lees. The results showed a good linear relationship between the antioxidant activities and the TPC and TTC, indicating that PN lees were better sources of phenolics and antioxidant activity than RL lees. The antimicrobial activity of wine lees was related to the phenolic composition rather than the quantity of total phenolics. Knowing the grape and wine processing conditions can provide some insights into the potential composition of wine lees and, hence, determine the potential economic use of the by-product.",
