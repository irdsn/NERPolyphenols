  "title": "Application of toasted vine-shoot chips and ultrasound treatment in the ageing of Primitivo wine.",
  "abstract": "Ageing wine in barrels is an historical practice used to improve the aromatic complexity of wine, but due to the high cost and the long ageing period, alternative approaches have been developed, such as the use of wood chips and ultrasound treatment. The present paper reports the results of an investigation performed on wine (cv. Primitivo). Three treatments were investigated: a) control wine untreated; b) wine with toasted vine-shoot chips (10\u00a0g/L); c) wine with toasted vine-shoot chips (10\u00a0g/L) and treated by ultrasound. Wines were analysed after 7, 14, 21, and 28\u00a0days. The application of ultrasound combined with vine-shoot chips promoted tannin evolution, thereby accelerating the ageing process of wine. The chips addition decreased the total anthocyanins content and increased the stilbenes (trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid) and wood-related aromas (i.e., furfural, 5-methylfurfural) concentration. Finally, wines added with chips were richer in woody, vanilla, oak, and chocolate notes and more preferred by the tasters.",
