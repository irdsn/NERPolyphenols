  "abstract": "A polyvinylimidazole-based cryogel is presented as a pioneering solution for efficient extraction and release of partially water-soluble polyphenols from olive byproducts. Specifically, oleuropein was used as model molecule to evaluate its recovery from water. The material merges the properties of interconnected cryogel structure in adsorbing molecules via fast diffusion flux, with the strong electrostatic interactions acted by imidazole moiety. Such cryogel achieves effective oleuropein binding likely through hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Comprehensive assessments of static adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and desorption kinetics underscore the cryogel's efficacy in oleuropein extraction and release, highlighting its pivotal role in valorizing olive wastewater through sustainable biotechnological applications.",
