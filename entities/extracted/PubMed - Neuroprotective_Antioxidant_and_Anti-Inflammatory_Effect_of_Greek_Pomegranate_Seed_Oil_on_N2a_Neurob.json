  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge with limited FDA-approved treatments, necessitating the search for novel preventive strategies. Antioxidants that are present in fruits and vegetables have garnered attention due to their potential neuroprotective effects. Among these, pomegranate (Punica granatumL.) has emerged as a promising source of neuroprotective antioxidants as it is rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and hydrolysable tannins. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) is a source of bioactive compounds that may modulate key pathological processes of AD. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of PSO in murine neuroblastoma N2a cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate AD-like inflammation. The effects of PSO on inflammation and oxidative stress markers, including TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, SOD1, and IL1\u03b2, were evaluated, along with changes in AD-related biomarkers A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and p-tau181. Additionally, the study extended its findings to clinical settings by assessing the impact of supervised PSO consumption for 12 months on similar biomarkers in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Results from this integrative approach demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of PSO, supporting its role in modulating AD-associated pathophysiology. These findings suggest that PSO may serve as an early-stage intervention to delay or mitigate AD progression, highlighting its therapeutic potential in preclinical and clinical contexts.",
