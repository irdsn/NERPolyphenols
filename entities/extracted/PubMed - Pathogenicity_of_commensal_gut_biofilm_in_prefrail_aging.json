  "abstract": "Pathophysiological mechanisms of unhealthy aging, particularly the transition from robustness to frailty, remain poorly understood. Despite extensive microbiome research on taxonomy, the behavior of early prefrail gut bacteria in their natural community-host mucosal tissue context remains unexplored. Using fecal samples from the INSPIRE-T aging human cohort, we characterized gut microbiota phenotype during prefrailty stages using a polymicrobial biofilm model. Results revealed that prefrail-derived biofilms exhibited distinct taxonomic and physical alterations, enhanced dispersal, and increased epithelial virulence compared to robust counterparts. Multiparametric analyses linked biofilm characteristics to clinical traits, suggesting their potential as aging status indicators. Polyphenol-rich grape pomace extract partially reversed prefrail biofilm alterations and reduced proinflammatory prefrail biofilm responses in vitro. Microbiota from prefrail-aged mice induced colon damage in antibiotic-treated recipients, establishing a prefrail microbiome-inflammation causality. Overall, the findings identified novel prefrail microbiome characteristics, established causal inflammatory links, and supported microbiota-targeted geroprotective interventions for the prefrail populations.",
