  "abstract": "Achieving durable bonding to dentin remains a challenge in restorative dentistry due to its complex structure and composition. Conditioning agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and proanthocyanidins (PACs), are used to modify the smear layer and enhance adhesion. PACs have shown promise in improving bond strength through collagen cross-linking. Thisin vitrostudy compared the effects of 17% EDTA and PAC conditioning on the shear bond strength of Giomer and Cention N to human dentin.",
