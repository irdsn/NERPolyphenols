  "abstract": "Dietary flavan-3-ols are known to mediate cardiovascular benefits. Currently, it is assumed that the levels of flavan-3-ol catabolites detected in humans, 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (\u03b3VL) and 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valeric acid (\u03b3VA), and their corresponding phase II metabolites, are determined exclusively by the action of the gut microbiome. However, a family of human proteins, paraoxonase (PON), can theoretically hydrolyze \u03b3VL metabolites into the corresponding \u03b3VAs. This study aims to determine if PON is involved in \u03b3VL and \u03b3VA metabolism in humans.",
