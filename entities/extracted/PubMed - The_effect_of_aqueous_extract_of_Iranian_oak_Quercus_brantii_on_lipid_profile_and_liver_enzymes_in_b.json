  "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia major patients often require regular blood transfusions, leading to iron overload, oxidative stress, and disturbances in lipid metabolism. The common use of vitamins and iron chelators helps mitigate some of these effects, but lipid profile abnormalities persist. The oak fruit (Quercus brantii) is rich in antioxidant compounds, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, which may help address these issues. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the aqueous extract of Iranian oak on the lipid profile and liver enzymes in beta-thalassemia major patients.",
