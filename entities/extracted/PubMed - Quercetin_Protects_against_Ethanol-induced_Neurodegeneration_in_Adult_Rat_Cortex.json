  "abstract": "Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been reported to possess several pharmacological activities including neuroprotective properties. Chronic alcohol exposure is known to cause apoptotic neurodegeneration. In this study, docking studies were used to investigate the ligand-protein affinity against various neuroinflammatory targets like ChAt, TNF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. Next, molecular studies were performed to determine quercetin activity against chronic ethanol- induced neurodegeneration in the adult rat cortex.",
