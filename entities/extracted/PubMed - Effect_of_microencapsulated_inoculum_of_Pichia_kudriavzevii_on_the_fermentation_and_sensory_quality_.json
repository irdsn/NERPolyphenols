  "abstract": "Microencapsulated yeasts are a novel alternative as a delivery matrix for microbiological starters. This technology aims to protect the active compounds from adverse environmental conditions and prolong their useful life and could also improve the conditions of the starters for cocoa fermentation. The present study established the effective dose to apply the microencapsulated yeast Pichia kudriavzevii as a microbiological starter of fermentation and biotechnological strategy for promoting the biochemical dynamics and sensory expression of the cocoa variety CCN-51. For this, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% of microencapsulated P. kudriavzevii yeast insolated from the artisanal fermentation process of cocoa was added to the cocoa mass to be fermented and studied on a laboratory scale.",
