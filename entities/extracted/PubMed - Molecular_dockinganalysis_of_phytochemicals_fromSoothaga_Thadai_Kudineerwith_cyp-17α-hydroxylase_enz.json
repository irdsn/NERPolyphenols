  "abstract": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects 9.2% of women of reproductive age and has doubled in prevalence, rising from 6 million cases in 1990 to 12.13 million in 2019. PCOS is characterized by symptoms like irregular periods, acne, hirsutism, male-pattern baldness, weight gain, mood swings and infertility. PCOS is primarily associated with elevated androgen levels. The use of IndianSoothaga Thadai Kudineerfor managing PCOS is well documented. Therefore, it is of interest to report theMolecular dockinganalysis of phytochemicals from IndianSoothaga Thadai Kudineerwith cyp-17\u03b1-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP17). Analysis shows that phytochemicals such as gingerenone A, chlorogenic acid and piperine present inSoothaga Thadai Kudineerexhibit strong binding affinities to the enzyme suggesting their potential as CYP17 inhibitors for further validation and consideration.",
