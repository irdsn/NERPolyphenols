  "abstract": "Kaempferol is a polyphenol in various fruits and vegetables. It is also commercially developed and sold to consumers as a supplement. It has been extensively assessed in clinical trials for clinical utility based upon its numerous experimentally based chemopreventive properties. Kaempferol has been evaluated at the levels of molecule, cell, and individual animal, showing a broad spectrum of biological effects. Kaempferol-induced hormetic concentration responses are common, being reported in many cell types and biological models for numerous endpoints. While the hormetic effects of kaempferol are biologically diverse, there has been a strong focus on age-related endpoints affecting numerous organ systems and endpoints, indicating that kaempferol is a senolytic agent, showing similar properties as quercetin and fisetin. This paper offers the first integrated evaluation of kaempferol-induced hormetic dose responses, their quantitative characteristics, mechanistic explanations, extrapolative strengths or limitations, and related experimental design, biomedical, therapeutic, ageing, and public health, including ageing related applications.",
