  "abstract": "To enhance the anticancer effects of the purslane extract, we developed a phytosomal nanocarrier with mitochondrial targeting capabilities. Initially, a phytosomal carrier was prepared and subsequently functionalized with a Szeto-Schiller (SS) peptide as, a mitochondrial-penetrating peptide, via a DSPE-PEG (2000)-malamide crosslinker. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis was conducted to quantify the amounts of quercetin and apigenin in the hydroalcoholic extract and the fractionated isolates obtained from diethyl ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water. The results indicated that both polyphenols were present in the hydroalcoholic extract, with apigenin being more abundant in the ethyl acetate fraction. Dynamic light scattering measurements revealed an average particle size of 112.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.758\u2009nm, a narrow polydispersity index of 0.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005, and a zeta potential of -30.67\u2009\u00b1\u20092.894\u2009mV. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the phytosomal carrier exhibited a spherical and intact morphology. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of the phytosomes were found to be 97% and 12.19%, respectively, for the ethyl acetate isolate. The in vitro drug release profile demonstrated a biphasic pattern, characterized by an initial burst release followed by prolonged sustained release. Cytotoxicity assays conducted on A549 and HFF cell lines revealed that the mitochondria-targeted phytosomal nanocarrier exhibited significant apoptotic effects (69.6%) on A549 cells, showing no significant toxicity toward HFF cells when compared with phosphatidylcholine, conventional phytosomal nanocarriers, and ethyl acetate-targeted phytosomal nanocarriers. The findings from this study represent a crucial advancement in the standardization of plant extracts and the development of herbal nanomedicine using targeted phytosomes.",
