  "abstract": "In this study, the effects of in-ovo injection of Chrysin (CR) into Japanese quail eggs on testicular histology, oxidant status and epididymal sperm quality were investigated. 720 Japanese quail eggs were divided into 4 groups and 0.1 mL saline was given to the control group, 0.25 mg CR to the 0.25 group, 0.50 mg CR to the 0.50 group and 0.75 mg CR to the 0.75 group. On the 60th day after the laying of eggs, 8 Japanese quails were randomly selected from each group and sacrificed under mild sevoflurane anesthesia. The abdominal cavity was opened and both testicular tissues and epididymal parts were removed. The right testicular tissue was used for histopathological examinations and the left one was used for biochemical analyses. The epididymal part at the tip of the vas deferens at the end of the right testis was trimmed in 100 \u03bcL saline at 37\u00b0C. Histopathological examinations showed that histological scoring was higher in the CR 50 and CR 75 groups. A decrease in oxidant status was observed in all CR groups compared to the control group. Spermatozoa density was higher in CR groups compared to the control group. Total motility value was statistically significantly higher in CR 50 and CR 75 groups compared to control and CR 25 groups. There was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of dead and abnormal spermatozoa. In-ovo CR injection at doses of 0.50 and 0.75 mg/egg improved testicular histological score, decreased oxidative stress, and increased epididymal sperm quality.",
