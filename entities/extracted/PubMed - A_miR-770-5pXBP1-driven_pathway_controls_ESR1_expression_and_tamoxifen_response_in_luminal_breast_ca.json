  "abstract": "Cancer cells employ various adaptive mechanisms to withstand stressors, with one notable pathway being the unfolded protein response (UPR), crucial in fostering endocrine resistance within ER-positive breast cancer. Investigating miRNAs within tumors holds promise for identifying key miRNA-gene interactions pivotal for tumor characteristics like proliferation and resistance to treatment. Notably, XBP1 emerges as a pivotal player in UPR within the endoplasmic reticulum, particularly through the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1\u03b1) - the X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway, presenting a compelling target for clinical intervention. In this study, I explore the regulatory role of miR-770-5p in modulating XBP1 expression and its potential as a therapeutic target in luminal breast cancer.",
