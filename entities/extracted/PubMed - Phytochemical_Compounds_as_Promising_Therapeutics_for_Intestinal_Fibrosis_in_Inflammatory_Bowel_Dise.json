  "abstract": "Intestinal fibrosis, a prominent consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), presents considerable difficulty owing to the absence of licensed antifibrotic therapies. This review assesses the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals as alternate methods for controlling intestinal fibrosis. Phytochemicals, bioactive molecules originating from plants, exhibit potential antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, targeting pathways associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Compounds such as Asperuloside, Berberine, and olive phenols have demonstrated potential in preclinical models by regulating critical signaling pathways, including TGF-\u03b2/Smad and NF\u03baB, which are integral to advancing fibrosis.",
