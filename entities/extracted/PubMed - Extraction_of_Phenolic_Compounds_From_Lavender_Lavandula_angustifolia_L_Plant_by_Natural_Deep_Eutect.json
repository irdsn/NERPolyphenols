  "abstract": "In recent years, it has been important in terms of green technology and sustainability to promote the use of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs), especially those based on natural products, for the extraction of bioactive components with different functional properties from foods. Therefore, in this study, the effects of green extraction technology (ultrasonic-assisted extraction) and green solvents (NADESs) on the recovery of bioactive components from lavender (Lavandula angustifolia L.) were investigated and evaluated. In addition, the degree of greenness of the analytical method used during the study was determined using the modified green analytical procedure index (MoGAPI). In this context, the total phenolic content (TPC), total antioxidant capacity, and individual polyphenolic profiles of lavender extracts prepared with two different NADES were investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrophotometer. Based on the results obtained, it was determined that NADES formed with choline chloride:formic acid (ChCl:FA) had a higher potential to extract bioactive components from lavender than NADES formed with ChCl:ethylene glycol (ChCl:EG). The TPC, antioxidant capacity, and total individual polyphenolic compound content of lavender extracted with these NADES were determined as 9.76\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalent/g, 20.83-104.39\u00a0mg Trolox equivalent/g, and 200.835\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. However, the degree of greenness determined by the MoGAPI tool of the analytical method used in this study was 78% and classified as 'excellent green'. As a result, it can be concluded that NADES formed with ChCl:FA can be an alternative to conventional solvents for the extraction of bioactive components from lavender, as it provides a remarkable recovery of bioactive substances.",
