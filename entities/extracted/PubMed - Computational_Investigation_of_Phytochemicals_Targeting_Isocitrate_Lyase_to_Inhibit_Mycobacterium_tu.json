  "abstract": "The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) remains a major concern for society that is worsening day by day with the emergence of drug-resistant TB as well as risks associated with latent TB. Isocitrate lyase (ICL) has been shown as a potential target that plays a role in the la-tent/dormant stage of M. tuberculosis. Several inhibitors against ICL have been designed and tested, which have various side effects.",
