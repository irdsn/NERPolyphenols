  "abstract": "Barringtonia acutangulaGaertn. is a well-known vegetable and medicinal plant. This study assessed solvents' effect on phytochemical contents and bioactivities of flower extracts. High-polar extracts (ethanol, aqueous) demonstrated much higher phenolic contents (132.21, 240.83\u2009mg gallic acid equivalent per gram of extract, respectively) than non-/medium-polar extracts, with more impressive flavonoid/saponin contents. Aqueous extract was highlighted for antioxidant activity and\u03b1-glucosidase inhibition (IC50= 35.01, 5.63\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively) on which HPLC analysis revealed gallic acid (1), pyrogallol (2), ilexsaponin A1 (3) as major compounds for 1.83, 1.26, 0.15%, respectively. Phenolics1and2displayed strong\u03b1-glucosidase inhibition (IC506.6\u2009-\u200918.7\u2009\u03bcM), consolidated by molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations, based on their stable complexes with\u03b1-glucosidase protein (MAL32)viaH-bonds of hydroxy phenol moieties, which was more effective in2. The study suggested the potency ofB. acutangulaflower water extract and its phenolics, displaying the need for in-depth investigation.",
