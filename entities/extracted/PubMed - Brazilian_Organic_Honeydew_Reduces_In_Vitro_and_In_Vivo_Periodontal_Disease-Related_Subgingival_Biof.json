  "title": "Brazilian Organic Honeydew Reduces In Vitro and In Vivo Periodontal Disease-Related Subgingival Biofilm.",
  "abstract": "We investigated the antimicrobial properties and effects on bone resorption of Brazilian organic honeydew (OHD) from the Bracatinga tree (Mimosa scabrellaBenth.), a rare honey certified with Denomination of Origin, using a periodontal disease model. Antibiofilm activity was assessed using a subgingival biofilm adhered to the Calgary device. Biofilms were treated with OHD, chlorhexidine (0.12%), or a vehicle twice daily for 1 min starting on day 3, at concentrations of 2\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). We employed a ligature-induced chronic periodontal disease model and challenged it withPorphyromonas gingivalisin C57BL/6 mice. The chemical profile of OHD was analyzed using LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Results were evaluated by measuring bone loss and microbial composition of the ligature biofilm through DNA-DNA hybridization. OHD demonstrated significant activity againstP. gingivalis(MIC 4%, MBC 6%) and reduced biofilm viability by 80% in vitro. In vivo, OHD decreased microbial populations and decreased bone loss associated with periodontal disease. Chemical analysis identified seven compounds in OHD, including five flavonoids and two lignans. This Brazilian honeydew from the Atlantic Forest exhibits strong antimicrobial properties and potential as a functional food for oral health, offering a promising alternative for the control and prevention of periodontal disease.",
