  "abstract": "Soybean (Glycine max) is one of Asia's most valuable oil crops, offering a rich source of dietary protein and bioactive compounds with diverse clinical applications. Key bioactive phytochemicals in soybean, including isoflavones, flavonoids, carotenoids, phytosterols, soyasaponins, fatty acids, and protein isolates, are known for their potential health benefits. These compounds exert functional properties by modulating critical metabolic pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), estrogen receptor (ER), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) pathways. With a growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence supporting the anticancer potential of soybean, this review systematically examines the role of soybean-derived bioactive components in the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first review to focus specifically on the impact of soy-derived bioactive components on lung cancer progression and modulation, offering insights into their mechanisms and potential as dietary interventions.",
