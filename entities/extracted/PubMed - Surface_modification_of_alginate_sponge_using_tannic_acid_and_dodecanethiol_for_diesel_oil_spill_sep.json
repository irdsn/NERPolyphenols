  "title": "Surface modification of alginate sponge using tannic acid and dodecanethiol for diesel oil spill separation from water.",
  "abstract": "An environmentally friendly absorbent sponge was successfully developed for diesel spill remediation via alginate polymer crosslinking followed by surface modification using tannic acid and dodecanethiol (TA/Do). The optimal sponge was obtained with a 3\u00a0h crosslinking duration, achieving a balance between absorption performance and structural durability, while longer crosslinking times led to increased density and reduced efficiency. Surface modification imparted hydrophobicity to the alginate sponge, confirmed by a water contact angle of 120.2\u00b0, and the successful incorporation of TA/Do was confirmed from FTIR and XPS analysis. The modified sponge (AA-3-TA/Do) exhibited a diesel absorption capacity of 17.54\u00a0g/g-a 36\u00a0% increase over the unmodified form-and retained \u223c90\u00a0% of this capacity after 34 absorption-desorption cycles. Kinetic modeling showed that diesel was rapidly absorbed during early contact, with faster uptake than water. A cytotoxicity assay confirmed its non-toxic nature, indicating environmental compatibility. This study demonstrates that a simple, scalable modification using accessible materials can significantly enhance oil sorbent performance without requiring complex techniques or hazardous reagents.",
