  "abstract": "Four previously undescribed phenolic compounds,1-4, including a racemic stilbene dimer featuring a rare benzobicyclo[4.2.1]nonene motif (1a/1b), a racemic 1,2-diarylpropanoid (3a/3b), and an aurone (4), along with 14 known metabolites, were isolated from the rhizomes ofHeterosmilax japonica. The structures of compounds1-4were identified by extensive HRESIMS, NMR data analysis, X-ray diffraction crystallography, and ECD calculation. The anti-inflammatory activities of compounds1-16were evaluated by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cell model. Compounds3and7significantly inhibited the release of NO in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, with IC50values of 5.7 and 5.3 \u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and NOS2) was also blocked by them in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, compounds3and7suppressed the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells.",
