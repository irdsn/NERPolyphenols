  "abstract": "Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) significantly impair small ruminant production globally, particularly in tropical regions. Anthelmintic resistance due to the indiscriminate use of synthetic drugs has necessitated the search for sustainable, plant-based alternatives. Eucalyptus wood vinegar (WV), a by-product of biomass pyrolysis, possesses bioactive compounds with potential anthelmintic activity. This study aimed to assess thein vitroovicidal efficacy of eucalyptus WV and WV derived from co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood withOriganum majorana(marjoram) against eggs of GINs from naturally infected sheep.",
