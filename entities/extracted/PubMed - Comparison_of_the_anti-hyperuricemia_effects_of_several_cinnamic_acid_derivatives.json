  "abstract": "Cinnamic acid derivatives, such as p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid, exhibit uric acid-lowering effects through the inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XOD). While the clinically used XOD inhibitor allopurinol is associated with significant side effects, these natural polyphenolic compounds exhibit comparable efficacy with improved safety.",
