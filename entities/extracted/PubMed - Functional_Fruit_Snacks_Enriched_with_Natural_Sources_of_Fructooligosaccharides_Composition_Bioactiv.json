  "abstract": "This study aimed to develop innovative fruit leather with programmed health-promoting properties, enriched with fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from chicory and Jerusalem artichoke. Their physicochemical properties were assessed, including the profile of polyphenolic compounds, pro-health effects, and sensory characteristics. The products contained various fruits (including pear, red currant, peach, and haskap berry) and 10% FOS powders. It was shown that the addition of FOS reduced acidity and total sugar content while increasing fiber content-especially fructans-and selected minerals (K, Mg, Zn). The addition of FOS also modulated the profile of polyphenolic compounds, whereas fruit leather without FOS was characterized by a higher concentration of these compounds. It was shown that the addition of chicory significantly modulates the ability to inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase. At the same time, in the case of the Jerusalem artichoke, the inhibition efficiency depends on the type of fruit matrix. Sensory-wise, the highest scores were given to recipes without FOS additives, with Jerusalem artichoke being better accepted than chicory. The results indicate the potential of using FOS as a functional additive, but their effects on taste and texture require further optimization.",
