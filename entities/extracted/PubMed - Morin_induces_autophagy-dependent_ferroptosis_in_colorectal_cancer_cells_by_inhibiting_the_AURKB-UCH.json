  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a significant threat to human health, and its underlying mechanisms require further exploration. Morin, a natural flavonoid, exhibits anti-CRC activity, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate its anti-CRC effects and elucidate its molecular mechanisms to provide new insights for CRC treatment.",
