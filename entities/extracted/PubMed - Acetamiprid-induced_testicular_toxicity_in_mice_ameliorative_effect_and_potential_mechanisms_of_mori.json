  "title": "Acetamiprid-induced testicular toxicity in mice: ameliorative effect and potential mechanisms of morin.",
  "abstract": "Acetamiprid (ACP) is a novel chloronicotinyl insecticide that has been extensively utilized in agricultural, domestic, and public health contexts for nearly two decades. However, its potential to induce organ damage, including reproductive toxicity in mammals, has emerged as a significant concern. Morin is a naturally occurring flavonol that has gained prominence as a food supplement in recent years due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of morin against testicular damage in mice subjected to ACP exposure.",
