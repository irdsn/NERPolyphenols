  "abstract": "The liver is an essential organ crucial for metabolism, detoxification, and maintaining homeostasis, faces growing global health challenges such as alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. These conditions collectively account for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although traditional treatments help control symptoms and slow disease progression, they are frequently hindered by issues such as drug resistance, side effects, and high costs, especially in areas with limited resources. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) continues to be a significant concern. Traditional medicine offers a promising avenue for addressing these limitations, with numerous plants demonstrating hepatoprotective properties through their bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, glycosides, and flavonoids. These natural agents not only mitigate hepatic damage but also provide immune modulation and chronic disease management. This review examines liver injury mechanisms and highlights the therapeutic potential of traditionally used medicinal plants in treating and preventing the liver diseases, emphasizing the integration of traditional knowledge with modern pharmacological advancements.",
