  "abstract": "Aging shows biologically complex features with high individual variability, which reflects the exposure to several stimuli and the adaptation to them. Among them, metabolic changes are well observed as consequences or possible causes of aging. Calorie restriction extends organismal life span in experimental models. Several metabolites; for example, resveratrol or nicotinamide mononucleotide, are reported to mimic calorie restriction effects in\u2009vivo. Metabolomic research would be useful to evaluate metabolites as biomarkers in aging-relevant events and to identify metabolic regulation of aging. We recently developed the metabolomic approach for whole blood analysis, which functions as strong tool for this purpose. We review the update findings in aging-relevant metabolites detected by this method. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024; 24: 44-48.",
