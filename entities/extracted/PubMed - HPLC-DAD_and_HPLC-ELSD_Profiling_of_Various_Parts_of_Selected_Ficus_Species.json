  "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of chemical data related to some Ficus species, forty-three ethanolic extracts were obtained from various parts of twelve Ficus species encompassing understudied ones. Thus, these were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and HPLC-evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) to explore their phytochemical profiles. Overall, most of the extracts contain predominantly compounds lacking chromophore visible only in HPLC-ELSD chromatograms. However, HPLC-DAD analyses revealed furanocoumarins psoralen and bergapten to be dominant in extracts of all parts of F. carica and F. pumila, together with the extract of the leaves of F. cyathistipula. Some extracts (e.g., those from F. microcarpa and F. lyrata) displayed only peaks corresponding to chlorogenic acid and its derivatives. Remarkably, the extract of the roots of F. cyathistipula is rich in prenylated isoflavones. This study brings an overview of dominant compounds present in selected Ficus species and points out huge differences in their phytochemical profiles.",
