  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a global issue affecting over a billion people, raising the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and other ailments. It is often characterized by hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or obesity, and hyperglycemia. Chemical investigation ofAeonium arboreum(L.) Webb & Berthel led to the isolation of six compounds, viz. \u03b2-sitosterol, \u03b2-sitosterol glucoside, myricetin galactoside, quercetin rhamnoside, kaempferol rhamnoside, and myricetin glucoside. Interestingly,A. arboreum's dichloromethane (DCM), 100 and 50% MeOH Diaion fractions and the isolated compound (quercetin-3-rhamnoside) revealed potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity, especially 50% Diaion fraction. In addition, they also showed very potent antioxidant potential, especially the polar fractions, using DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, ORAC, and metal chelation assays. Notably, the 50% Diaion fraction had the highest antioxidant potential using DPPH and ORAC assays, while the 100% Diaion fraction and quercetin-3-rhamnoside showed the highest activity using ABTS, FRAP, and metal chelation assays. Also, quercetin-3-rhamnoside showed a good docking score of -5.82 kcal/mol in comparison to acarbose. In addition, molecular dynamic stimulation studies illustrated high stability of compound binding to pocket of protein. Such potent activities presentA. arboreumas a complementary safe approach for the management of diabetes mellitus as well as MetS.",
