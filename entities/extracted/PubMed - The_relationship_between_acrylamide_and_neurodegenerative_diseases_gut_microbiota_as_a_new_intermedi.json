  "title": "The relationship between acrylamide and neurodegenerative diseases: gut microbiota as a new intermediate cue.",
  "abstract": "Acrylamide (AA), a compound formed during the thermal processing of high-carbohydrate foods, has been implicated in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. An increasing number of reports support that gut microbiota plays a significant role in brain function and diseases, suggesting it may act as a mediator between AA exposure and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Available studies have shown that AA intake affects the composition of the gut microbiota and the integrity of the intestinal barrier, both of which are often thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, given the numerous evidences linking gut microbiota with the brain. Based on the current understanding, this paper discusses that AA induces the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases by disrupting the composition of the gut microbiota and the structure of the intestinal barrier. Furthermore, it explores the interaction between probiotics and AA exposure, as well as the potential for polysaccharides and polyphenols to improve the gut microenvironment, which provides novel perspectives on modulating the neurodegenerative diseases caused by AA exposure through diet.",
