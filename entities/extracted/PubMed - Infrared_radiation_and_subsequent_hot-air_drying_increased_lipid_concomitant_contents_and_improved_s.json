  "abstract": "Camellia oleifera is a woody oil-bearing crop, and the quality of its seeds and pressed oil is affected by the postharvest drying. In order to find a suitable drying method for camellia seeds maintaining their good qualities, effects of three drying methods, including room temperature (RT) drying, 60\u2009\u00b0C hot-air (HA) drying, as well as 600-800\u2009W infrared pre-drying and sequential 60\u2009\u00b0C hot-air (IR-HA) drying, on the drying efficiency, qualities and storage stabilities of camellia seeds were compared.",
