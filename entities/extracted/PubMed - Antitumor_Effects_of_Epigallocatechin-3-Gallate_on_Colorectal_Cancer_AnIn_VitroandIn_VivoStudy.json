  "abstract": "Tea consumption is widely reported to have beneficial effects on cancer prevention. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major bioactive component of green tea, has demonstrated anti-proliferative effects against various cancer cell types. This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effects of EGCG on human colon and colorectal cancer cells bothin vitroandin vivoand to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with its antitumor activity.",
