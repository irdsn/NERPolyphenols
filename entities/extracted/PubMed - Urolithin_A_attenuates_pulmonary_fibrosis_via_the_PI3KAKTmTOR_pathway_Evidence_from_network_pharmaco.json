  "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis(PF) is an abnormal wound-healing response resulting from recurrent alveolar injury, characterized by persistent inflammation and excessive collagen deposition. Given the limited clinical treatment options, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Urolithin A (UA), a secondary metabolite produced by intestinal microbiota from natural polyphenols, has attracted attention due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aging properties. However, the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of UA in PF remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of UA in PF.",
