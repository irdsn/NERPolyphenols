  "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of paeonol in ameliorating chronic stress-induced amygdala neuronal injury via modulation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2)/calcineurin signaling pathway. Paeonol, a polyphenolic compound from Moutan Cortex, exhibits therapeutic effects. Studies show it alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behaviors in mice, though its mechanisms remain unclear.",
