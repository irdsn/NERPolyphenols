  "abstract": "Aging is characterized by progressive multisystem deterioration driven by molecular and cellular mechanisms encapsulated in the twelve hallmarks of aging. Green tea (GT), derived from Camellia sinensis, has garnered significant scientific interest due to its rich polyphenolic composition, particularly epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and its pleiotropic health benefits. In this narrative review, we explored the multifaceted mechanisms through which GT may mitigate the aging hallmarks. Evidence from in vitro, animal, and human studies has shown that GT polyphenols can enhance DNA repair pathways, preserve telomere length, modulate epigenetic aging markers, improve proteostasis and autophagic flux, regulate nutrient-sensing networks, and rejuvenate mitochondrial function. Additionally, GT exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and may restore a physiological gut microbiota composition. Beyond molecular and cellular effects, GT consumption in humans has been associated with improved cognitive function, cardiovascular health, muscle preservation, and metabolic regulation in aging populations. Collectively, these findings highlight GT's potential as a naturally occurring geroscience intervention capable of addressing the interconnected network of aging processes more comprehensively than single-target pharmaceuticals. Future research should focus on optimizing dosing regimens, exploring synergies with other anti-aging strategies, and investigating personalized responses to GT interventions.",
