  "abstract": "The Caryocar genus includes Caryocar brasiliense, Caryocar villosum, and Caryocar coriaceum, known as pequi, piqui\u00e1, and piqui, respectively. They grow in the Cerrado and Amazonian biomes, significantly impacting the local economy. Caryocar spp. fruits are rich in carotenoids, lipids (oleic and palmitic acid), dietary fiber, zinc, magnesium, calcium, and polyphenols. These bioactive compounds potentially prevent and treat several non-communicable diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This narrative review discusses the potential advantages of Caryocar spp. including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and the effects on renal insufficiency. The literature review shows that nutritional interventions are essential for CKD patients. Previous studies with Caryocar spp. demonstrate that cardiovascular protective effects due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of biodiversity in human health promotion. In conclusion, this review offers a theoretical foundation for Caryocar spp. as a potential nutraceutical in the context of CKD and highlights its value as a key component of a sustainable diet.",
