  "abstract": "Sphaerocoryne affinis is traditionally utilized in Vietnam for the production of alcoholic beverages. This study represented the first comprehensive investigation into the phytochemical profile and anti-inflammatory properties of S. affinis fruit. Using the RAW264.7 macrophage model stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, this study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory potential of S. affinis fruit ethanol extract, primarily through nitric oxide (NO) inhibition. The results revealed that ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on both NO radicals and NO production. Furthermore, thirteen compounds were successfully isolated, including chrysin (1), (5Z,7R)-acetyl melodorinol (2), daucosterol (3), pinocembrin (4), naringenin (5), melodorinol (6), (4Z)-5-(2,3-dihydroxy-propylidene)-5H-furan-2-one (7), (-)-malic acid (8), (E)-3-(furan-2-yl)acrylic acid (9), p-coumaric acid (10), caffeic acid (11), chlorogenic acid (12), and 5-O-(E)-p-coumaroylquinic acid methyl ester (13). Among these, seven compounds (5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13) were identified for the first time in this species, offering significant insight into its phytochemical profile and therapeutic potential.",
