  "abstract": "To further explore strain potential and develop an aromatic kiwifruit wine fermentation technique, the feasibility of simultaneous inoculation by non-Saccharomyces yeast and lactic acid bacteria was investigated. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Limosilactobacillus fermentum, which have robust \u03b2-glucosidase activity as well as good acid and ethanol tolerance, were inoculated for simultaneous fermentation with Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Meyerozyma guilliermondii, respectively. Subsequently, the chemical compositions and sensory characteristics of the wines were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that the majority of the simultaneous protocols effectively improved the quality of kiwifruit wines, increasing the content of polyphenols and volatile compounds, thereby enhancing sensory acceptability compared to the fermentation protocols inoculated with non-Saccharomyces yeast individually. Particularly, the collaboration between Lacp. plantarum and Z. rouxii significantly increased the diversity and content of esters, alcohols, and ketones, intensifying floral and seeded fruit odors, and achieving the highest overall acceptability. This study highlights the potential significance of simultaneous inoculation in kiwifruit wine production.",
