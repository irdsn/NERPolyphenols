  "abstract": "Among fruits susceptible to enzymatic browning, olive polyphenol oxidase (OePPO) stood out as being unisolated from a natural source until this study, wherein we successfully purified and characterized the enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of heated and nonheatedOePPO revealed distinct molecular weights of 35 and 54 kDa, respectively, indicative of its oligomeric nature comprising active and C-terminal subunits.OePPO displayed latency, fully activating with 5 mM SDS under optimal conditions of pH 7.5 and 15 \u00b0C. The enzyme demonstrated monophenolase activity and showcased the highest efficiency toward hydroxytyrosol. Despite its low optimal temperature,OePPO exhibited high thermal resistance, maintaining stability up to 90 \u00b0C. However, beyond this threshold, the oligomeric enzyme disassociated, yielding a denatured main subunit and C-terminal fragments. SixOePPO genes were found in the fruits. Tryptic digestion identified the enzyme as matureOePPO1 (INSDC OY733096), while mass spectrometry detected the active form mass alongside several C-terminal fragments, revealing potential cleavage sites (Gly407, Tyr408).",
