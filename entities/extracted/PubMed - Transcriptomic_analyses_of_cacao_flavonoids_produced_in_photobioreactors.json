  "abstract": "Theobroma cacao is a major source of flavonoids such as catechins and their monomers proanthocyanidins (PAs), widely studied for their potential benefits in cardiovascular diseases. Light has been shown to promote plant secondary metabolite production in vitro. In this study, cacao cells cultured in 7.5\u2009L stirred tank photobioreactors (STPs) were exposed to a change of white to blue LED lights for 28\u2009days (d).",
