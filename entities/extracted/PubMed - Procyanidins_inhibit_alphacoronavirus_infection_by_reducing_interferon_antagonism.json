  "abstract": "The development of coronavirus drugs has primarily focused on targeting viral components, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), with relatively little attention given to enhancing host antiviral defenses. \u03b1-Coronaviruses, including human-infecting HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, utilize immune evasion strategies such as suppressing host interferon production to establish infection. Procyanidins (PC), oligomeric compounds composed of catechin and epicatechin, have demonstrated the ability to stimulate host interferon synthesis, potentially counteracting this immune evasion. Exploring the inhibitory effects of PC specifically on \u03b1-coronaviruses offers a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategies that bolster host immunity against these pathogens.",
