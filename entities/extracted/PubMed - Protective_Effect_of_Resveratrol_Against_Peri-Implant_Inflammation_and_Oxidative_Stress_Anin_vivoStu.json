  "title": "Protective Effect of Resveratrol Against Peri-Implant Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: Anin vivoStudy.",
  "abstract": "Implants are commonly used to repair teeth. However, with their widespread use, the incidence of peri-implantitis has also increased. The Mitogen activated protein kinase/Protein kinase B/Nuclear factor kappa-B (MAPK/AKT/NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway is associated with various inflammatory responses. This study aims to evaluate the role of resveratrol in managing peri-implant inflammation and its regulatory effect on the MAPK/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",
