  "title": "Multilayer biocomposite vegan leather materials derived from vegetable-tanned fungal biomass cultivated on food waste.",
  "abstract": "Despite being considered a premium material, leather poses both environmental and ethical issues. Thus, sustainable alternatives such as vegan leather are in high demand. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to produce vegan leather using vegetable tannins and fungi grown on bread waste. Fungal cultivation was carried out in a bubble column bioreactor using nutrients extracted from bread as substrate. To obtain tanned biomass, the biomass was subjected to vegetable tanning (using Tara, Myrobalan, Chestnut, and Indusol ATO tannins). A mild alkali treatment isolated the fibrous cell wall material from fungal biomass. Different composite sheets were prepared by wet-laying the tanned biomass and cell wall material and placing them in a multilayer arrangement. The composites were post-treated with glycerol and a bio-based binder to improve their mechanical properties. Myrobalan-tanned biomass composites after glycerol and bio-based binder post-treatments had the highest flexibility of 14.8% elongation at break, and Tara-tanned biomass composites had the highest tensile strength of 20.5 MPa. Ashby's chart demonstrates the relationship between the sheets produced and natural leather. SEM was used to demonstrate the softer and smoother morphologies of the Chestnut and Indusol ATO-tanned composite sheets after post-treatment. Overall, this study presents multilayer fungal biocomposites as a promising vegan alternative leather.",
