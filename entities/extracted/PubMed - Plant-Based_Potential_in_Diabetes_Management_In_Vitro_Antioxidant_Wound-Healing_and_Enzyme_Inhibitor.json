  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by impaired glucose regulation. This study evaluated the antioxidant and antidiabetic potential of aqueous extracts from four plant species from the southern Algarve:Aristolochia baetica,Chelidonium majus,Dittrichia viscosa, andLavandula viridis, using non-cellular in vitro assays. HPLC/PDA was used to identify active compounds. Antioxidant activity was assessed by using TAA, FRAP, RP, and DPPH assays; antidiabetic potential through \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibition; and wound healing relevance through elastase, collagenase, and lipoxygenase inhibition.D. viscosashowed the highest antioxidant activity (FRAP: 1132.99 \u00b1 19.54 mg TE/g dw; DPPH IC50= 25.85 \u00b1 0.75 \u03bcg/mL) and total phenolic/flavonoid content, with a diverse profile including caffeic and chlorogenic acids, isoquercetin, and quercetin. It also exhibited potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition (IC50= 0.61 \u00b1 0.06 mg/mL), outperforming acarbose.L. viridishad the highest total phenolic content (39.04 mg/g), whileA. baeticademonstrated the strongest anti-elastase, anti-collagenase, and lipoxygenase activity, suggesting wound-healing potential.C. majusshowed the weakest effects. A strong correlation was observed between phenolic content and antioxidant/antidiabetic activity. These findings support further in vivo studies onD. viscosaandA. baeticafor potential use in T2DM management and diabetic wound healing.",
