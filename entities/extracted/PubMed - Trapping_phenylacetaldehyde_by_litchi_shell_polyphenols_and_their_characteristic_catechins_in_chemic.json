  "abstract": "Inhibitory effects of litchi shell polyphenols (LC) and their characteristic catechins on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazole [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP) formation were investigated in chemical model and roast pork patty. Eight catechins-adducts were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and their toxicity were evaluated by Discovery Studio. Results showed inhibition rates of LC on bound-PhIP could reach 10.95\u00a0% and 100\u00a0% respectively in both chemical model and roast pork patty, and inhibition rates on free-PhIP could reach 76.47\u00a0% in roast pork patty. However, LC had no inhibiting effect on free-PhIP, and even promoted it in chemical model. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS indicated that Epicatechin (EC), Epigallocatechin (EGC) and Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) eliminate PhIP by capturing phenylacetaldehyde to form adducts. LD50of the formed adducts were lower than the chronic rat oral loael value, indicating that EC, EGC and EGCG would not form more toxic adduct during PhIP reduction. This study provides a new perspective for the application of LC in inhibiting PhIP and a reference for improving the theoretical system of dietary polyphenols in inhibiting heterocyclic aromatic amines.",
