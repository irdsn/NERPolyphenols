  "abstract": "Self-crosslinked poly(ionic liquid)s (CPIs), a subset of ionic liquids, are emerging functional polymeric materials with broad applications in catalysis and sensor technology. However, there are scant reports on the use of CPIs as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) stationary phases. Fluorinated materials, noted for their unique physicochemical properties, have recently drawn interest in purification and separation fields.",
