  "abstract": "The study aimed to determine the relative contribution of peroxide value (PV), acid value (AV), conjugated diene value (CDV), carbonyl value (CV), saturated fatty acids (SFA) extent, the ratio between the extents of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids, total tocopherols (TT, as mg of \u03b1-tocopherol per kg of oil) content, and total phenolic compounds (TP, as mg of gallic acid per kg of oil) content to the initiation (Oi) and propagation (rn) oxidizabilities of vegetable oils (canola, soybean, sesame, corn, peanut, olive, and rice bran). The parameter Oiwas a function of TT (24.6\u00a0%), MUFA/PUFA ratio (20.7\u00a0%), PV (19.3\u00a0%), CV (18.9\u00a0%), and TP (16.5\u00a0%), respectively. The parameter rnwas affected by SFA (29.7\u00a0%), TP (22.4\u00a0%), CDV (19.5\u00a0%), PV (10.9\u00a0%), CV (10.5\u00a0%), MUFA/PUFA ratio (4.4\u00a0%), and TT (2.6\u00a0%), respectively.",
