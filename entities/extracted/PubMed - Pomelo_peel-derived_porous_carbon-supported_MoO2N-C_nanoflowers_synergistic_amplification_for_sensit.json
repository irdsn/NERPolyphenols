  "title": "Pomelo peel-derived porous carbon-supported MoO2@N-C nanoflowers: synergistic amplification for sensitive sensing of kaempferol.",
  "abstract": "Kaempferol (KA), a natural polyphenolic compound with potent anti-cancer activity and pharmacological benefits, exhibits dose-dependent toxicity upon excessive intake. In this work, the MoO2@N-C/PC-800 composite was synthesized to overcome the application limitations of single-component transition metal oxides, effectively enhancing the reduction current signal during the electrochemical detection of KA. Notably, combined SEM/TEM/XPS analyses demonstrate that the composite's hierarchical crumpled architecture exposes abundant electroactive sites, thereby achieving superior sensing performance. The sensor constructed based on MoO2@N-C/PC-800 exhibited a broad detection range of 0.01-30 \u03bcM for KA with an ultralow limit of detection (LOD) of 9.8 nM. To validate the reliability of electrochemical sensing results, UV-Vis was employed as a reference method for comparative analysis of\u00a0 real samples. The sensor's KA concentration measurements were cross-validated against UV-Vis-determined values, yielding recoveries\u00a0 of 95.5-106.0% and relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 1.12-2.29%, which demonstrate excellent consistency between the two methods.",
