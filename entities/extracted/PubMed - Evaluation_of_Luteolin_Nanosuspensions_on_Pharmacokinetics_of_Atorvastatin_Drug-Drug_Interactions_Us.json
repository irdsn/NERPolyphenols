  "abstract": "The co-administration of luteolin (LUT) and atorvastatin (ATV) may drive synergetic effects on against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This study aims to explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of LUT toward ATV and the influencing mechanisms involving CYP450s and OATPs, and using the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models extrapolated to humans to optimize the DDIs dosage regimens for subsequent research.",
