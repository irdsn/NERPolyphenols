  "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of resveratrol on the tumor microenvironment in osteosarcoma. Methods A C57BL/6 xenograft mouse model was established and treated with resveratrol. Single-cell sequencing was performed to analyze changes in the tumor microenvironment. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess immune cell infiltration, while Western blotting was conducted to examine alterations in cellular signaling pathways. Results Resveratrol significantly inhibited the proliferation of LM8 osteosarcoma cells in C57BL/6 mice compared to the control group. Additionally, CD8+T cell recruitment was enhanced. The Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway was notably downregulated in LM8 osteosarcoma cells following resveratrol treatment. Conclusion Resveratrol promotes CD8+T cell infiltration by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent in osteosarcoma treatment.",
