  "abstract": "Psoriasis is an enduring inflammatory skin disorder defined by recurring attacks, distinguished primarily by red patches and scaly skin. Quercetin, a kind of natural flavonoid compound, is widely found in various vegetables, fruits, and Chinese herbs. Quercetin is a multifaceted compound with a wide range of potential health benefits. In addition to antioxidant, cardiovascular protection, and anti-tumor effects, quercetin has shown potential in regulating immune and inflammation effects. In the initial stages,in vivostudies have demonstrated that quercetin positively affects psoriasis and is connected with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (AKT)/glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) signaling. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which quercetin influences the PI3K/AKT/GLUT1 signaling cascade in the context of psoriasis remains uncertain.",
