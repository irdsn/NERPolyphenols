  "abstract": "Despite the presence of several wild edible plants in Ethiopia, communities across the country continue to face serious food and nutrition challenges. The study was carried out to evaluate nutritional composition, anti-nutritional factor content, mineral composition, and mineral bioavailability inMussaenda arcuata fruits,Celosia trigyna leaves, andPteridium aquilinum frondsconsumed in the southwestern parts of Ethiopia and reported as dry weight basis. The study result revealed that they are rich in crude fiber content, which may play a role in reducing serum cholesterol and blood pressure and the risk of coronary heart disease. The leaves ofCelosia trigynaandPteridium aquilinumwere wild edible plants rich in protein, ranging from 29.89 to 31.76\u2009g/100\u2009g. TheMussaenda arcuata fruitwas characterized by a higher crude fat (6.47\u2009g/100\u2009g) and a higher total energy content (332.72\u2009Kcal/100\u2009g). The study also found that minerals such as K, Na, Ca, Mg, P, Zn, and Fe were present at optimal and safe levels, with their molar ratios falling within acceptable limits. The contents of the anti-nutritional factors (condensed tannins, phytate, and oxalate) were below the maximum acceptable limits and did not affect the bioavailability of calcium, iron, and zinc. Therefore, the fruits ofMussaenda arcuata,Celosia trigynaleaves, and fronds ofPteridium aquilinumare important wild edible plants that can contribute to improving food and nutritional security in the region.",
