  "title": "Theabrownin: The 'rich hue' of Chinese dark tea, its extraction, and role in regulating inflammation and immune response.",
  "abstract": "Theabrownin (TB) is one of the most representative bioactive components in Chinese dark tea, often referred to as the \"gold in dark tea.\" The complex macromolecular structure of TB is influenced by its source (tea materials), extraction, separation, and purification methods, which affect its final structure and bioactivity. In recent years, research on TB has surged, becoming a hotspot in the field of tea functional components and health research. Extensive studies on its health benefits indicate that TB is a crucial active ingredient in dark tea with substantial potential for application in food, health care, industry, and medical fields. This review summarizes the formation of TB during dark tea manufacturing, especially the \"piling\" stage, extraction methods, various purification techniques, and the physicochemical properties of TB. Additionally, it comprehensively reviews recent research on TB's role in typical inflammation and immune imbalance-induced diseases such as colitis, atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and innate immune diseases. The review concludes with a comparative summary of the biological activities of TB from the five major types of Chinese dark tea in terms of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects.",
