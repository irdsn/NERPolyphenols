  "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by airway remodeling with increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass which contributes significantly to the progressive decline in lung function in asthma patients. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies targeting airway remodeling, their efficacy remains suboptimal. Procyanidin B2, antioxidants derived from grape seeds, have demonstrated potential benefits in the treatment of asthma. However, the role of procyanidin B2 involved in mitigating the process of airway remodeling and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",
