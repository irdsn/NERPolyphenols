  "abstract": "In this study, the submerged fermentation of summer green tea with Aspergillus cristatus (MK346334) was developed to enhance the utilization of summer green tea and produce theabrownins (TBs) efficiently. TBs1 and TBs2 were obtained from the fermentation broth by traditional preparation method with organic solvents and an environmentally friendly dialysis method, respectively. Similar structural characteristics and 86 common thiol degradation products identified demonstrated that the dialysis method could substitute organic solvents for removing small molecules. In addition, the results of chemical composition and molecular weight analyses indicated that TBs2 from the dialysis method contained fewer free catechins and more polysaccharides, which might lead to fewer free small molecules and a more compact structure in TBs2. Both TBs1 and TBs2 exhibited good performance in antioxidant activity. This study confirmed the feasibility of the dialysis in TBs preparation and provided further support for the structural and functional study of TBs.",
