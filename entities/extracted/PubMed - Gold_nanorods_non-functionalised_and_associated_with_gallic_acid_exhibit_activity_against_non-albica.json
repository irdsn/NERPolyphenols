  "abstract": "Strategies focusing on natural compounds and nanotechnology have been explored to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies in managingCandidainfections. In this context, metal nanoparticles, both non-functionalised and combined with gallic acid, may offer a promising alternative. This study investigated the effects of gold nanoparticles non-functionalised (AuNp) and associated with gallic acid (AuNpGA) against planktonic cells and biofilms ofNakaseomyces glabratus,Pichia kudriavzevii,Candida parapsilosis, andCandida tropicalis. Both AuNp and AuNpGA inhibited the growth of all strains at 1.56\u2009\u00b5g/mL and exhibited fungicidal effects at concentrations ranging from 1.56 to 3.12\u2009\u00b5g/mL. The time-kill curve revealed that AuNpGA and AuNp completely inhibited the viability of all strains in planktonic cultures at 8 and 24\u2009h, respectively, exhibiting greater antifungal activity compared to fluconazole. Treatment with AuNp increased ROS production againstN. glabratusandP. kudriavzevii.Oxidative stress was enhanced against all strains after treatment with AuNpGA, and exposure to this compound reduced ergosterol levels ofP. kudriavzeviiandC. parapsilosis.Furthermore, AuNpGA and AuNp significantly decreased the viability of allCandidabiofilms at 7.8 and 15.6\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively. In summary, both gold nanoparticles exhibited activity against planktonic cells and biofilms, suggesting their potential as agents for treatingCandidainfections.",
