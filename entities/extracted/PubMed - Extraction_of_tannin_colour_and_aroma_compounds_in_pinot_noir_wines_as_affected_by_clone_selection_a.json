  "abstract": "Our previous study revealed stem inclusion fermentation reduced anthocyanin, and increased tannin and aroma compounds responsible for green notes. This study further investigated the effect of clone selection and whole bunch fermentation on Pinot noir wine composition, with focus on tannin composition. Three treatments were conducted using two clones (AM10/5 and UCD5) in 2021 and 2022: 100% destemmed (DS), 30% whole bunch (WB30), and 60% whole bunch (WB60). WB60 increased stem and skin derived tannins but reduced seed derived tannin proportion in wines. Clone selection had an impact on tannin composition and an even greater impact on tannin concentration, colour, and aroma compounds. AM10/5 produced wines with higher tannin, polymeric pigments and darker colour. AM10/5 wines also had higher concentration of phenylethyl alcohol, but lower concentrations of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine and ethyl esters, indicating more floral but less fruity and green notes.",
