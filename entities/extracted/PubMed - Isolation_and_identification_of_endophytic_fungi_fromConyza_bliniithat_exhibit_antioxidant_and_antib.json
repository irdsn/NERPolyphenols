  "abstract": "As a medicinal plant,Conyza bliniiis known to contain a wealth of bioactive constituents, including flavonoids, terpenes, and triterpenoid saponins, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. Endophytic fungi, which symbiotically inhabit plant tissues, are recognized for their ability to synthesize bioactive metabolites analogous to those of their hosts. However, the potential ofC. blinii-associated endophytes remains underexplored. This study aims to isolate and characterize phenols-producing endophytic fungi fromC. blinii, evaluate their biological activities, and analyze their chemical components to provide new insights for drug development.",
