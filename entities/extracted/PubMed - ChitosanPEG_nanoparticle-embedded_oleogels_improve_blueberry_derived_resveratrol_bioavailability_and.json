  "abstract": "Blueberry polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with a plausible role in preventing chronic diseases. However, applications in food or supplements is limited by low bioavailability. This study was aimed to formulate oleogel-blueberry extract encapsulated systems with chitosan/polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance resveratrol delivery and bioavailability while retaining bioactivity. NPs were formulated via ionic gelation at pH\u00a05.5 and mixed with soybean (SO), peanut (PO), or hemp oil (HO) to create solid oleogels containing 25\u00a0% or 32\u00a0% oil with lecithin and sitosterol. Rheological analysis confirmed solid-like properties. HO oleogels showed the highest resveratrol delivery (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and superior chemical stability. Resveratrol release from HO improved bioactive penetration and intracellular antioxidant capacity in cultured Caco-2 intestinal cells, with no toxicity observed. These findings support expanding oleogels as delivery vehicles for blueberry polyphenolics, like resveratrol.",
