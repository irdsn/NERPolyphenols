  "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, contributes to oxidative stress-related skin damage. This study evaluates the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of a nanoformulation derived from an Annurca apple callus extract in an in vitro model of ferroptosis using human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). A hydroalcoholic extract from light Annurca apple callus (LCE) was nanoformulated with Pluronic\u00aeF127 and Soluplus\u00aeto enhance stability and bioavailability. The resulting nanoformulation (NF-LCE) exhibited optimal particle size (103.17 \u00b1 0.87 nm), polydispersity index (0.21 \u00b1 0.00), and zeta potential (-1.88 \u00b1 0.64 mV). Iron overload (100 \u00b5M) was employed to induce oxidative stress and inflammation in HaCaT cells, resulting in elevated levels of inflammatory markers (COX2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and a diminished antioxidant response, as indicated by decreased expression of GPX4 and Nrf2. NF-LCE treatment restored GPX4 and Nrf2 levels (~0.8-fold increase,p< 0.05) while significantly reducing COX2 (36.6%,p< 0.01), IL-6 (79.6%,p< 0.0001), and TNF-\u03b1 (30.9%,p< 0.1). These results suggest NF-LCE as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating ferroptosis-induced skin damage, warranting further investigation in advanced skin models and clinical applications.",
