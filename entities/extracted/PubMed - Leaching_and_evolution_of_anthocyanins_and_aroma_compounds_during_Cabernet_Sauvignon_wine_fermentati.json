  "abstract": "This study explores the leaching and evolution of anthocyanins and aroma compounds during wine-making, using an industrial-scale vinification of Cabernet Sauvignon with whole-process skin-seed contact. The results indicated that compounds within the same class displayed similar evolutionary patterns during fermentation. The extraction of anthocyanins, C6 aldehydes, and \u03b2-damascenes occurred continuously during cold soak, accompanied by the conversion of C6 aldehydes into alcohols and hydrolytic release of glycosidic \u03b2-damascenone. During alcoholic fermentation, pyranoanthocyanins, polymeric pigments, esters, benzene compounds, higher alcohols, and acids were generated. The concurrent occurrence of malolactic fermentation and prolonged maceration led to aromas associated with lactic acid bacteria metabolism. Finally, a comparison between free-run wine and pressed wine revealed high concentrations of C6 compounds and polymeric pigments with flavanol dimers in the pressed wine. These results can be used as a reference to optimize the vinification process to enhance the red due and fruity aromas of the wine.",
