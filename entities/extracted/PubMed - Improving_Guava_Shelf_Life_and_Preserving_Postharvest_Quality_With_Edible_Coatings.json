  "title": "Improving Guava Shelf Life and Preserving Postharvest Quality With Edible Coatings.",
  "abstract": "Guava (Psidium guajavaL.) is a nutrient-dense climacteric fruit, but is prone to rapid postharvest deterioration due to physicochemical changes, leading to substantial quality and economic losses. This study investigated the efficacy of edible coatings-chitosan 2% (CH 2%), cinnamon essential oil 2% (CEO 2%),aloe veragel 30% (AVG 30%), propolis 10% (PR 10%), and gum arabic 10% (GA 10%)-applied individually and in combination (15 total formulations, excluding control) to extend shelf life and maintain postharvest quality. Fruits treated with these coatings were stored under ambient conditions (20\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and compared to uncoated controls. Results revealed that edible coatings significantly (p\u2264\u20090.05) delayed deteriorative processes, with the CH 2%\u2009+\u2009GA 10% blend demonstrating optimal performance. Notably, this formulation minimized weight loss (6.31%), retained firmness (4.11\u2009kg/cm2), and preserved color attributes. Additionally, it maintained superior biochemical quality, including titratable acidity (0.322%), ascorbic acid (198.22\u2009mg/100\u2009g), total antioxidants (136.76\u2009mM Trolox/100\u2009g), and phenolic content (177.03\u2009mg GAE/100\u2009g), with extended shelf life up to 12\u2009days. The findings underscore the potential of chitosan-gum arabic composite coatings as a sustainable, natural solution to mitigate postharvest losses in guava, offering actionable strategies for enhancing storability and marketability without reliance on synthetic additives.",
