  "abstract": "Aging-related skin fibrosis (SF) is a complex condition with limited treatment options. Procyanidin C1 (PCC1), a natural polyphenolic compound with demonstrated senolytic activity, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for fibrotic disorders through its selective elimination of senescent cells. However, its therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms in aging-related SF remain unclear.",
