  "abstract": "Sakura, a traditional edible flower, has been investigated for its anti-glycation potential; however, the bioactive components remain unclear. Polyphenols are recognized for their exceptional anti-glycation properties. In this study, main polyphenols were identified from seven varieties through metabolomics. 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-OCA), 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3-OCA), and caffeic acid were confirmed as key agents through multivariate analysis, which was further validated by anti-glycation assessments. The concentrations of these polyphenols inCerasus serrulata 'Kanzan'(CK) were 2.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08, 3.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 and 2.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0mg/g, respectively, contributing to its superior AGEs inhibition ratio (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) of 76.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0%. Simulated digestion revealed that isomerization between 5-OCA and 3-OCA occurred during the gastric phase. Both compounds were metabolized to caffeic acid in the intestinal phase, contributing to a sustained anti-glycation activity of 64.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.11\u00a0%. Overall, our study provides a theoretical basis for the development of Sakura-based functional foods targeting anti-glycation.",
