  "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the striatum, a brain region responsible for movement control. The disease is characterized by the mutant huntingtin (mHtt) proteins with an extended polyQ stretch, which are prone to aggregation. These mHtt aggregates accumulate in neurons and are the primary cause of the neuropathology associated with HD. To date, no effective cure for HD has been developed.",
