  "abstract": "Cisplatin (DDP), a platinum-based chemotherapy drug, shows broad antineoplastic activity, however, its clinical use is limited by dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, a major challenge in cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which quercetin-polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone (Que-PEG-PCL) micelles simultaneously enhance the cytotoxicity of DDP against cancer cells and reduce its nephrotoxicity.",
