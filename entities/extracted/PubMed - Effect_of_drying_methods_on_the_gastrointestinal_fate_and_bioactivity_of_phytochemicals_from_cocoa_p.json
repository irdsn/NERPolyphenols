  "abstract": "Cocoa pod husk (CPH) contains many nutraceutical phytochemicals whose gastrointestinal fate and bioactivity can be affected by drying methods. Microwave (MW), forced-air drying (AF), and AF plus extrusion (AF-E) dried CPH samples were chemically characterized, and their phenolic and theobromine (THB) contents were evaluated under oral-gastric-intestinal (in vitro) and colonic fermentation (ex vivo). Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADEMT) properties of CPH's small molecules were evaluated in silico. The chemical composition of CPH [mostly carbohydrates/insoluble dietary fiber], polyphenol [total polyphenols\u00a0>\u00a0condensed tannin (CT)\u00a0>\u00a0monomeric flavonoids] differed minimally among samples, except for THB content (AF/AF-E\u00a0>\u00a0MW) and antioxidant capacity (MW\u00a0>\u00a0AF/AF-E). Time- trend gastrointestinal (X3behavior) and colonic bioaccessibility were AF/AF-E\u00a0>\u00a0MW, but phenolic acids, procyanidins, and THB fluctuated in a sample-specific fashion. In silico modeling showed that bioactives of CPH easily crossed the intestinal epithelium illustrating their bioaccessibility and, permeability. These bioactives can act as receptor ligands in a structure-dependent manner, suggesting their use as a functional ingredient.",
