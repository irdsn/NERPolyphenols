  "abstract": "This study investigated the use of daylily as a novel adjunct in craft beer production with fourSaccharomycesyeast strains. The addition of daylily powder and yeast selection significantly influenced the physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, and overall metabolome of the beers. Yeast strains exhibited variations in color, alcohol content, phenolic and flavonoid levels, and antioxidant capacity. Metabolomic analysis revealed differences in lipid, amino acid, tannin, and fatty acid synthesis between strains. Volatile profiles also differed markedly in esters, terpenes, higher alcohols, acids, and aldehydes. While 90\u00a0% of metabolites were conserved, key differences reflected distinct metabolic regulation among strains. These findings highlight the potential of daylily as a flavorful and bioactive beer ingredient, and emphasize the importance of targeted yeast selection for optimizing beer quality and metabolome. This work provides a practical framework for brewers to develop innovative beers with enhanced functional properties and specialized flavor profiles.",
