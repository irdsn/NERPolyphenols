  "abstract": "Rutin and quercetin are natural flavonoids with a variety of beneficial health effects, including anticancer activity. In the present study, we compared cytotoxicity and chemosensitization of human colon cancer HCT116 cells to anticancer drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and doxorubicin (DOX) by both compounds.",
