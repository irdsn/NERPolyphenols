  "abstract": "In fibrotic skeletal muscles, excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is a result of increased activation and decreased apoptosis of myofibroblasts. The aim of this study is to investigate whether treatment with quercetin, kaempferol or capsaicin can reduce the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21)-induced myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic ECM expression in differentiated C2C12 cells. Two-day-differentiated C2C12 cells were treated with TGF-\u03b21 for 48 h to induce myofibroblast differentiation. Twenty-four hours before (pre-treatment) and for forty-eight hours with (co-treatment) TGF-\u03b21 treatment, cells were exposed to quercetin (25, 50 \u00b5M), kaempferol (10, 25, 50 \u00b5M) or capsaicin (25, 50 \u00b5M). The immunofluorescence intensity of alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and collagen type I/III gene expression were assessed as myofibroblast markers. MyoD immunofluorescence intensity was measured as a myogenic marker. Co-treatment of TGF-\u03b21 with the phytochemicals was most effective, resulting in a decreased number of \u03b1SMA-positive cells (all three compounds), decreased collagen type I (kaempferol, capsaicin) and type III (kaempferol) gene expression, and increased MyoD (kaempferol, capsaicin) protein expression compared to TGF-\u03b21 treatment. This study demonstrates that treatment with quercetin, kaempferol or capsaicin can reduce myofibroblast markers. This suggests a possible anti-fibrotic effect of the phytochemicals in skeletal muscle.",
