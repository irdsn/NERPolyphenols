  "abstract": "This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between gut microbiota, diet, and insulin resistance, emphasizing the novel roles of diet-induced microbial changes in influencing metabolic health. It highlights how diet significantly influences gut microbiota composition, with different dietary patterns fostering diverse microbial communities. These diet-induced changes in the microbiome impact human metabolism by affecting inflammation, energy balance, and insulin sensitivity, particularly through microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Focusing the key mediators like endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, and introduces personalized microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, it also investigates the effects of dietary components-fiber, polyphenols, and lipids-on microbiota and insulin sensitivity, along with the roles of protein intake and amino acid metabolism. The study compares the effects of Western and Mediterranean diets on the microbiota-insulin resistance axis. Therapeutic implications, including probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and personalized diets, are discussed. Key findings reveal that high-fat diets, especially those rich in saturated fats, contribute to dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, while high-fiber diets promote beneficial bacteria and SCFAs. The review underscores the future potential of food and microbiota interventions for preventing or managing insulin resistance.",
