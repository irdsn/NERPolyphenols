  "abstract": "Polyphenols are responsible for wine colour and astringency, and, as antioxidants, they also have beneficial health properties. In this work, we developed a robust full-scan high-resolution mass spectrometry method for the quantification of 90 phenolic compounds in wine samples (either red, ros\u00e9, or white wine), using a UHPLC-OrbitrapTMsystem. With this method, we could conduct a detailed analysis of phenolic compounds in red, ros\u00e9, and white wines with great selectivity due to sub-ppm mass accuracy. Moreover, accessing the full-scan spectrum enabled us to monitor all the other compounds detected in the sample, facilitating the adaptability of this method to new phenolic compounds if needed.",
