  "abstract": "The study of the phenolic compounds present in olive leaves (Olea europaea) is of great interest due to their health benefits. In this research, different machine learning algorithms such as RF, SVM, and ANN, with temperature, time, and volume as input variables, were developed to model the extract yield and the total phenolic content (TPC) from experimental data reported in the literature. In terms of extract yield, the neural network-based ANNZ-Lmodel presents the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) value in the validation phase (9.44 mg/g DL), which corresponds with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.7%. On the other hand, the best model to determine the TPC value was the neural network-based model ANNR, with an RMSE of 0.89 mg GAE/g DL in the validation phase (MAPE of 2.9%). Both models obtain, for the test phase, MAPE values of 4.9 and 3.5%, respectively. This affirms that ANN models would be good modelling tools to determine the extract yield and TPC value of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) process of olive leaves under different temperatures, times, and solvents.",
