  "abstract": "Plant-derived nanoparticles are gaining attention for enhancing the delivery and bioavailability of bioactive compounds, though the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate dried hawthorn-derived nanoparticles (DHNPs), focusing on their composition, molecular interactions and impact on polyphenol absorption. The results showed that DHNPs, averaging 275.7\u00a0nm, were primarily composed of polysaccharides and high content of polyphenolic compounds (\u223c25%), with covalent and non-covalent interactions forming between them. Saponification increased the polyphenol release, and metabolomics identified 252 polyphenolic compounds, with 195 showing a relative increase post-treatment, including caffeic acid and (-)-catechin. An in vitro intestinal absorption test using Caco-2 cell monolayer model demonstrated that DHNPs-bound polyphenols exhibited significantly higher permeability (27.90%) compared to free polyphenols (12.38%), indicating that endocytosis may serve as a potential pathway through which DHNPs enhance polyphenol absorption. This study provides new insights into the role of plant-derived nanoparticles contributing to bioactive compound delivery and bioavailability.",
