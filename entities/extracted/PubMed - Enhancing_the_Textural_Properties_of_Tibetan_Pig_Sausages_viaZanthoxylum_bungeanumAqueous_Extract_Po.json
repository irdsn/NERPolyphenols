  "abstract": "The mechanistic effects ofZanthoxylum bungeanumon the textural properties of Tibetan pig sausages remain inadequately elucidated. We conducted a dose-response analysis usingZ. bungeanumaqueous extraction (ZBAE) containing 36.97 mg GAE/g polyphenols, applied at concentrations from 0.125% to 1.20% in the meat paste. Optimal textural enhancement was achieved at 0.25% ZBAE, as proved by significantly improving water holding capacity (1.77% increase), hardness (139.87% increase), and gel strength (46.04% increase) relative to the control group (p< 0.05). Specifically, this concentration: (i) promoted protein molecular rearrangement of by enhancing hydrophobic interactions (33.33% increase) and hydrogen bonding (287.99% increase); (ii) induced conformational transitions from\u03b1-helix (42.62% decrease) to\u03b2-sheet formations (21.11% increase); and (iii) generated a homogeneous three-dimensional protein network characterized by a fractal dimension of 2.769 \u00b1 0.006 and a porosity of 38.350 \u00b1 0.333%. The addition of natural polyphenols from Z.bungeanummay optimize the textural quality of processed meat products.",
