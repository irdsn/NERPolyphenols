  "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) exacerbates neuronal damage through mechanisms including apoptosis and autophagy dysregulation. Resveratrol (Res), a natural polyphenol with neuroprotective properties, may alleviate CIRI-induced damage by modulating key signaling pathways. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of Res on CIRI, focusing on its role in balancing apoptosis and autophagy via regulation of nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2) and tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28).",
