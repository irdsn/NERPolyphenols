  "abstract": "Heavy metal pollution in water poses severe ecological and health risks, necessitating efficient remediation methods. This study introduces porous, lightweight calcium alginate-tannic acid (PCA/TA) composite beads, fabricated using sodium alginate (SA), tannic acid (TA), and CaCO\u2083. The decomposition of CaCO\u2083 in HCl releases Ca2+and CO\u2082, crosslinking SA into a gel and creating a porous structure, as confirmed by SEM and XRD analyses. The buoyant beads exhibit excellent dispersion and recovery properties, making them highly suitable for water treatment applications. FTIR and XPS characterization revealed that TA enhances metal chelation through phenolic hydroxyl groups, significantly improving adsorption capacity. Systematic experiments demonstrated that PCA/TA beads achieve high adsorption capacities of 302.96\u00a0mg/g for Pb2+and 238.39\u00a0mg/g for Cu2+, with the process following pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm, indicating chemisorption. DFT calculations further elucidated the adsorption mechanism, highlighting the synergistic effect between SA and TA. The beads also exhibited excellent regeneration potential, maintaining high efficiency over multiple cycles. This work presents a green, cost-effective solution for heavy metal removal, offering valuable insights for the design of sustainable adsorbents in large-scale water treatment applications.",
