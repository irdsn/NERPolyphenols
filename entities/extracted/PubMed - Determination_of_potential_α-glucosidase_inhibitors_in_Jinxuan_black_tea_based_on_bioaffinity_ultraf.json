  "abstract": "The search for natural \u03b1-glucosidase (\u03b1-Glu) inhibitors has gained significant attention in developing novel antidiabetic agents or functional foods. Low-temperature fermented Jinxuan black tea represents a promising source of such bioactive compounds. Sixteen potential \u03b1-Glu inhibitors were identified from the tea using 10\u00a0kDa affinity ultrafiltration. Key compounds, including theaflavin (TF), theasinensin A (TSA), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), were identified. The inhibitory activity was assessed via IC50determination, with TSA showing the highest potency. Structural mechanisms were investigated through fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and molecular docking. TSA exhibited remarkable \u03b1-Glu inhibition (IC50=\u00a05.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0\u03bcM) and was the abundant active constituent (3.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0mg/g). Oxidative dimerization of EGCG to form TSA enhanced inhibitory effects, primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, with the 7-OH group on the A ring playing a critical role. The hypoglycemic effect of low-temperature fermented Jinxuan black tea is largely attributed to TSA's potent \u03b1-Glu inhibition. These findings provide mechanistic insights into black tea's antidiabetic properties and support its potential application in functional food development.",
