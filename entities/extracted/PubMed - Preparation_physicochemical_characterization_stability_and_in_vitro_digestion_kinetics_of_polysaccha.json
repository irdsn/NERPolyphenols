  "abstract": "The study explored the mechanism of different polysaccharides (chitosan, sodium alginate (SA), pectin and inulin) modifications of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) nanoliposomes (NL) and their effects on the in vitro stability of liposomes. After polysaccharide coating, the particle size of liposomes increased, but the polydispersity index (PDI) did not change significantly. C3G liposomes coated with SA showed the highest encapsulation rate of 80.13\u00a0%, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that all polysaccharide-coated C3G liposomes had a dispersed spherical shape. According to the infrared spectrum analysis, the polysaccharide coating enhanced the hydrogen bond interactions. A 4-week stability evaluation indicated that SA-C3G-NL were more stable than other coated liposomes. The results of in vitro release and simulated gastrointestinal digestion experiments demonstrated that polysaccharide-modified liposomes had a more remarkable sustained-release effect. Compared with uncoated C3G liposomes, the sustained release rates of SA-coated and inulin-coated C3G liposomes were delayed 37.34\u00a0% and 39.52\u00a0%, respectively. Collectively, these findings broadened the applications of polysaccharide-coated liposomal carriers for encapsulation and controlled release of anthocyanins.",
