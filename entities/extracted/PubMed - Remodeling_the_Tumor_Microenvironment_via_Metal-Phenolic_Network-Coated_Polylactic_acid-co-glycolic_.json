  "abstract": "The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) primarily relies on chemotherapy following surgical intervention. However, many late-stage NSCLC patients exhibit drug resistance and experience significant side effects from current chemotherapy agents, ultimately leading to disease progression. Consequently, the development of strategies to enhance efficacy while minimizing side effects through multimodal synergistic treatment technologies remains challenging. Here, we prepared a stable multifunctional nanocomplex, PLGA@DTX@Fe3+-TA/GOX(PDFTG), which utilizes poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles to encapsulate docetaxel (DTX) as the core component, while a Fe3+-tannic acid (TA) nanonetwork serves as the outer coating. Additionally, interactions between polyphenols and proteins facilitate the loading of glucose oxidase (GOX). After intravenous injection, PDFTG selectively accumulates in the tumor region, subsequently releasing Fe3+, TA, DTX, and GOX, thereby remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Following this process, Fe3+is reduced to Fe2+by TA, leading to mitochondrial damage in cancer cells and resulting in an increase in O2content. This increase promotes the GOX-catalyzed glucose oxidation reaction that generates gluconic acid and H2O2, initiating starvation therapy. The gluconic acid enhances the acidity of the microenvironment, further promoting the release of PDFTG nanoparticles and enhancing the accumulation of H2O2within the cell. The accumulated H2O2reacts with Fe2+in a strongly acidic environment, leading to the of hydroxyl free radicals that initiate chemical dynamic therapy (CDT). Moreover, mitochondrial damage results in a reduction of adenosine triphosphate levels, which decreases the expression of P-glycoprotein, thereby reversing DTX resistance and producing potent multimodal synergistic antitumor effects. Multimode treatment strategies for reshaping the tumor microenvironment offer an approach with significant clinical application potential for the efficient treatment of NSCLC.",
