  "abstract": "Testicular aging manifests as impaired spermatogenesis and morphological alterations in Drosophila. Nonetheless, the comprehensive molecular regulatory framework remains largely undisclosed. This investigation illustrates the impact of copper overload on testicular aging and underscores the interplay between copper overload and lncRNA. Copper overload triggers Cuproptosis through the mitochondrial TCA cycle, facilitating intracellular interactions with Ferroptosis, thereby governing testicular aging. Dysfunction of lncRNA:CR43306 also contributes to testicular aging in Drosophila, emphasizing the significance of lncRNA:CR43306 as a novel aging-associated lncRNA. Moreover, copper overload exacerbates spermatid differentiation defects mediated by lncRNA:CR43306 deficiency through oxidative stress, copper, and iron transport. Therapeutically, Ferrostatin-1 and Resveratrol emerge as potential remedies for addressing testicular aging. This study offers perspectives on the regulatory mechanisms involving copper overload and lncRNA:CR43306 deficiency in the context of testicular aging.",
