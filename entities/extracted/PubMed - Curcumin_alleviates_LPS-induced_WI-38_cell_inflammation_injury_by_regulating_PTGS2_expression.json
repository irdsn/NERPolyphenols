  "abstract": "Infantile pneumonia is a common infectious disease affecting infants and young children, which can lead to severe complications such as heart failure, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality rates among affected populations. Curcumin (CUR), a prominent natural polyphenol found in turmeric and other species of Curcuma, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Consequently, CUR has been hoped to be a therapeutic or preventive agent for several main human diseases. This study aims to explore the effects of CUR on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated Wistsar Institute (WI)-38 cells.",
