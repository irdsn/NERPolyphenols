  "title": "Medicinal Mushrooms in Colon Cancer Therapy: Mechanisms of Action of Bioactive Compounds and Therapeutic Potential.",
  "abstract": "Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. This is commonly observed among older adults, and the occurrence of colon cancer is mainly influenced by unhealthy lifestyle factors. Edible medicinal mushrooms have been demonstrated to have anti-colon cancer effects both individually and in combination with conventional therapies, including synergistically enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy medications such as 5-fluorouracil in preclinical models. Medicinal mushrooms such asLentinus edodes,Phellinus linteus,Ganoderma lucidum,Inonotus obliquus,Pleurotus ostreatus,Hericium erinaceus,Pleurotus eryngii,Gloeostereum incarnatum, andTermitomyces heimiiare emerging as promising candidates, not only because conventional treatments for colon cancer face significant limitations, including side effects, psychological impacts on patients, high cost, limited specificity toward cancer and healthy cells, and the development of drug resistance, but also due to the diverse array of bioactive compounds present within them. Therefore, there is a strong demand for innovative, affordable, and minimally invasive treatments such as medicinal mushrooms. Their bioactive compounds, including terpenoids, sterols, phenols, polysaccharides, acids, sesquiterpenes, alkaloids, lactones, metal-chelating agents, nucleotide analogs, glycoproteins, \u03b2-glucan, cerebrosides, steroids, terpenes, quinolones, anthraquinones, benzoic acid derivatives, linoleic acid, ascorbic acid, glycosides, organic acids, flavonoids, grifolin, tocopherols, proteins, indoles, lectin, and laccases, exert anti-colon cancer activities through various mechanisms, including anti-proliferative effects, cell cycle arrest, anti-inflammatory effects, antioxidant effects, induction of apoptosis, cytotoxic effects, and antimigratory effects. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and confirm the safety and efficacy of medicinal mushrooms as a holistic anti-colon cancer treatment.",
