  "title": "Examining the role of polyphenols in the in vitro starch hydrolysis of gluten free enriched flatbreads.",
  "abstract": "Polyphenols have been often related with reducing starch digestibility. Gluten free breads are rich in starch, their enrichment in phenolic acids can modulate starch digestibility. Aim is to evaluate the effect of three powdered ingredients (artichoke, tomato, lemon) at varying concentrations (2, 5, and 10\u00a0g/100\u00a0g) on the technological and in vitro digestibility of gluten free flatbreads (FB). The polyphenols profile content of the FB was quantified, and they were correlated with in vitro starch digestion parameters. The incorporation of artichoke, tomato, lemon powders in FB reduced luminosity and hardness. Specific phenolic compounds were identified in artichoke FB (apigenin-7-O-glucoside, syringic acid, catechin gallate, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, and luteolin-7-O-rutinoside), and in lemon FB (eriocitrin and hesperidin). The principal component analysis indicated that lemon-enriched FB exhibited the lowest starch hydrolysis, potentially due to its acidic pH and polyphenols content. These functional ingredients provide a promising alternative to obtain innovative gluten free bakery products.",
