  "abstract": "A high fat, high carbohydrate (HFHC) meal can induce adverse triglyceride (TRG), glucose, and metabolic load index (MLI; TRG\u2009+\u2009glucose) in middle-aged and older adults. A bout of exercise (EX) or an acute meal may attenuate these postprandial responses. This study aimed to determine whether a high polyphenol, high fiber meal with and without EX could reduce postprandial TRG, glucose, and MLI in this population. In a randomized crossover design, 10 healthy adults (56.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009years, 6F, 4M) completed four conditions: (1) traditional HFHC, (2) T-HFHC + EX, (3) HFHC meal with polyphenols and fiber (P-HFHC), (4) a P-HFHC + EX. Each participant consumed 12 kcals/kg body mass. The P-HFHC was made with plant-based ingredients to match the macronutrient composition of the T-HFHC. EX, performed 30\u2009min post-meal, expended 25% of kcals consumed. Blood TRG and glucose were measured for 6\u2009h post-meal, and MLI was calculated. There was a significant time*condition interaction for TRG (p\u2009=\u20090.038), glucose (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and MLI (p\u2009=\u20090.026). The P-HFHC condition had lower TRGs at 4 and 5\u2009h (p\u2009=\u20090.031, p\u2009=\u20090.050). These findings suggest that a minimally processed meal or EX may reduce CVD risk in middle-aged and older adults.",
