  "abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to several diseases, including primary effusion lymphoma, multicentric Castleman's disease, and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome. Current treatment options for KSHV-associated diseases are sometimes ineffective, and antiviral drugs are still lacking. Calycosin (CA), an O-methylated isoflavone found in Astragalus membranaceus, has previously demonstrated strong activity against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but its effect against KSHV has not been previously reported.",
