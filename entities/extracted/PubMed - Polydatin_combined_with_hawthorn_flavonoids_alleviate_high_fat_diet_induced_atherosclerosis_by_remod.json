  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a widely studied pathophysiological foundation of cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation and dyslipidemia are risk factors that promote the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The gut microbiota and their metabolites are considered independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. Polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids, as the extracts ofPolygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. andCrataegus pinnatifida Bunge, have shown excellent cardiovascular protective effects. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Our study aimed to explore the anti-atherosclerotic mechanism through gut microbiota and their metabolites.",
