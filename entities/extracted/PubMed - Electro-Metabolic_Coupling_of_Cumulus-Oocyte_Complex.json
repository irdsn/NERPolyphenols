  "title": "Electro-Metabolic Coupling of Cumulus-Oocyte Complex.",
  "abstract": "Oocyte-cumulus cell interaction is essential for oocyte maturation and competence. The bidirectional crosstalk network mediated by gap junctions is fundamental for the metabolic cooperation between these cells. As cumulus cells exhibit a more glycolytic phenotype, they can provide metabolic substrates that the oocyte can use to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. The impairment of mitochondrial activity plays a crucial role in ovarian aging and, thus, in fertility, determining the success or failure of assisted reproductive techniques. This review aims to deepen the knowledge about the electro-metabolic coupling of the cumulus-oocyte complex and to hypothesize a putative role of potassium channel modulators in order to improve fertility, promote intracellular Ca2+influx, and increase the mitochondrial biogenesis and resulting ATP levels in cumulus cells.",
