  "title": "Enhancement of Oryzanol application by constructing modified \u03b2-CD inclusion complex and polycaprolactone-chitosan electrospun fiber membranes: Perspectives on wound dressings and grape preservation.",
  "abstract": "Oryzanol has a variety of physiological activities and is widely used in food and medicine. However, its utilization form and bioavailability are limited by poor solubility and photothermal stability. In this paper, an inclusion complex (IC) was prepared by modifying \u03b2-cyclodextrin as a molecular carrier to encapsulate Oryzanol. Polycaprolactone-chitosan (PCL-CS) and IC were prepared into a fiber membrane (PCL-CS-IC) using an electrostatic spinning technique and applied to wound healing and grape preservation. The results showed that the prepared ICs had a drug loading rate of 43.18\u00a0% with good antimicrobial, wettability, and air permeability properties. The PCL-CS-IC effectively reduced the inflammation of mouse wounds, with obvious re-epithelialization and inflammatory factors reduction in skin tissues. Meanwhile, the PCL-CS-IC delayed the decay process of grapes and extended shelf life. In conclusion, this study effectively improved the utilization of oryzanol and provided potential ideas for wound dressing preparation and food packaging materials development.",
