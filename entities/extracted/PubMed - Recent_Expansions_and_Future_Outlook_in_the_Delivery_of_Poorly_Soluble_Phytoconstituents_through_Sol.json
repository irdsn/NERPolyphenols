  "title": "Recent Expansions and Future Outlook in the Delivery of Poorly Soluble Phytoconstituents through Solid Dispersion Technique.",
  "abstract": "Phytoconstituents, derived from plants, possess significant therapeutic potential but often face challenges such as poor solubility and low bioavailability, limiting their efficacy. Solid dispersion (SD) is a promising approach to improve the solubility and bioavailability of these poorly water- soluble phytoconstituents. By dispersing the active drug in a hydrophilic carrier, solid dispersion enhances the surface area of the drug, improving its dissolution rate and enhancing absorption. This review provides an overview of the various generations of solid dispersions, highlighting the evolution from crystalline carriers in first-generation solid dispersions to the more advanced amorphous solid solutions in second and third-generation formulations, which offer enhanced solubility and bioavailability. The article also discusses various techniques for preparing solid dispersions, including solvent evaporation, melting, and spray-drying methods, and emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate carriers, such as hydrophilic polymers, to optimize the dissolution rate of phytoconstituents. The study highlighted the recent case studies on several phytochemicals, like alkaloids, glycosides, Polyphenols, etc., demonstrating the effectiveness of solid dispersion in improving their solubility and therapeutic performance. Additionally, the review addresses the challenges related to the solubility of phytoconstituents and their impact on drug absorption, as well as the role of solid dispersion in overcoming these challenges. Overall, solid dispersion technology emerges as a versatile and effective tool for enhancing the oral bioavailability of phytoconstituents, paving the way for more efficient herbal therapies in modern medicine.",
