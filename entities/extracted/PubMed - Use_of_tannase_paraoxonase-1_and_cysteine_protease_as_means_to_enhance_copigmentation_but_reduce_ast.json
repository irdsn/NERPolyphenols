  "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effects of tannase, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and/or cysteine protease (CP) on the copigmentation of individual anthocyanins, astringency and other sensory properties (odour, colour and overall liking) of pomegranate juice (PJ) during storage at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. CP increased (20.7-41.3\u00a0%) the stability of all 3,5-diglucosidic anthocyanins. \"Tannase+PON-1\" and \"tannase+PON-1\u00a0+\u00a0CP\" caused a significant increase (8.8-12.1\u00a0%) in total monomeric anthocyanin content, colour density and hyperchromic effect. The most effective anthocyanin for copigmentation was delphinidin-3-glu, followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-glucoside. Interactions between these anthocyanins and enzymatic degradation products (HHDP-galloyl-glucuronide, punicalin, gallic acid and ellagic acid) resulted in copigmentation without adding external copigment. Moreover, increasing the gallic acid content caused a greater enhancement of visually perceived colour. Hydrolysis of ellagitannins with a m/z ratio ([M-H]-)\u00a0\u2265\u00a0801 (i.e., punicalagins, punigluconin and trigalloyl-HHDP-glucose isomer) reduced the astringency in PJ. Considering the high copigmentation effect, good sensory properties and lower cost, we recommend the use of \"tannase+PON-1.\"",
