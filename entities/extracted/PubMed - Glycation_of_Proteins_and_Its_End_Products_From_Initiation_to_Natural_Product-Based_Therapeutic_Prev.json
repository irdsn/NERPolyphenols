  "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, which lead to the glycation of proteins and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These AGEs contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation, and the development of complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and anemia, significantly increasing mortality rates among diabetic patients. This Review focuses on the role of glycation inhibitors as a potential strategy to prevent AGE-related pathologies. While synthetic glycation inhibitors have shown promise, their adverse effects highlight the need for safer alternatives. We specifically explore a range of natural compounds-flavonoids, curcuminoids, terpenes, stilbenes, lignans, and coumarins-that have demonstrated significant antiglycating properties. The mechanisms through which these natural products inhibit glycation, including antioxidant activity, metal ion chelation, and direct interference with the glycation process, are discussed in detail. This review underscores the potential of natural products as effective and safer glycation inhibitors, offering a promising avenue for the development of therapeutic strategies against diabetes and AGE-related disorders.",
