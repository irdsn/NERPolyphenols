  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other cognitive impairment conditions in elderly are defined by progressive loss of neurons, based mostly on oxidative stress, long-term neuroinflammation, and compromised neuroplasticity. In the midst of increasing investigation for natural drugs, Moringa oleifera, a plant highly accepted for its high nutritional and phytochemical constitution, has become an active candidate with multi-oriented neuroprotective activity. This review discusses the therapeutic potential of Moringa oleifera in neurodegeneration, based on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. The plant's bioactive molecules, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and vitamins exhibit potent free radical-scavenging activity and the ability to modulate crucial inflammatory signaling pathways, like NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling. Additionally, Moringa oleifera is shown to possess the potential for enhancing neurogenesis, facilitating synaptic plasticity, and neuronal apoptosis protection. Preclinical evidence supports its efficacy in decreasing neuropathological alterations and enhancing cognitive function, whereas initial clinical data suggest a benign safety profile. In spite of these promising observations, additional work is required to confirm its action in human subjects and to standardize therapeutic regimens. This review highlights the promise of Moringa oleifera as an adjunct treatment for the prevention and management of neurodegenerative disorders and points to avenues for future investigation and clinical utility.",
