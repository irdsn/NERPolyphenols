  "title": "Encapsulation of Polyphenolic Preparation in Gelatin Fruit Jellies Slows the Digestive Release of Cholinesterase Inhibitors In Vitro.",
  "abstract": "Peach, apricot, chokeberry, blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, and wild strawberry fruits were used to create a polyphenolic preparation (PP) after enzyme-assisted extraction, ultrafiltration, and concentration. The composition of PP was determined using LC-MS. Gelatin jellies produced with PP, as well as liquid PP, were \"digested\" in an in vitro model. The entrapment of PP in the gelatin matrix delayed the release of total polyphenolics, flavonoids, flavanols, condensed tannins, and anthocyanins (predominantly during the \"small intestinal\" phase). PP entrapped in the jelly more effectively (p< 0.05) decreased the activity of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, cyclooxygenase-2 and catalase (during the \"small intestinal\" phase). However, no significant (p< 0.05) effects on superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities were observed. FRAP, CUPRAC, HORAC, oxidation of linoleic acid, and ABTS-reducing activities were higher during the \"intestinal\" phase; however, the DPPH test and \u03b2-carotene bleaching tests did not confirm these results. The presented findings may be useful for designing nutraceuticals with programmed release of bioactive compounds during digestion.",
