  "abstract": "The human body can spontaneously repair damaged bone tissue and cells; however, external interventions are required to support bone regeneration when the defect exceeds a critical threshold. Bone repair primarily involves the regeneration of both bone and cartilage defects. Natural polyphenols, characterized by polyphenolic hydroxyl structures, readily integrate with other biomaterials to modulate endogenous microenvironment regulation and enhance bone defect repair.",
