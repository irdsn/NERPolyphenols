  "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms underlying disruptions in brain glucose uptake and metabolism, linked with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, are only partially understood. This study investigated how soluble amyloid beta (sA\u03b2) peptides affect glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the primary portal for glucose entry into the brain. We demonstrated that [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) uptake is reduced in sA\u03b2 overproducing APP,PS1 transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, the influx rate of18FDG decreased in sA\u03b240 or sA\u03b242 pre-infused mice, highlighting the inhibitory effect of sA\u03b2 peptides on glucose transport at the BBB. Consistently, the expression of GLUT1, the primary glucose transporter at the BBB, is reduced in polarized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) monolayers upon exposure to sA\u03b2 peptides and in A\u03b2-laden cerebral vasculature in vivo. The study further examined the influence of sA\u03b2 on the insulin-AKT pathway, known to regulate glucose uptake through modulation of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression. Results showed that sA\u03b2 peptides suppress AKT phosphorylation and reduce GLUT1 expression by upregulating TXNIP levels in hCMEC/D3 monolayers. Co-incubation of resveratrol with sA\u03b2 peptides reduced TXNIP expression and rectified reductions in GLUT1 expression. In summary, toxic sA\u03b2 impairs BBB glucose transport by disrupting the insulin/AKT/TXNIP axis.",
