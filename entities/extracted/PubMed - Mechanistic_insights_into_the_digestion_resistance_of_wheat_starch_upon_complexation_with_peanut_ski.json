  "abstract": "Modification with peanut skin polyphenols (PPs) may retard starch digestion, while the modulation mechanism and the primary factor responsible for digestion resistance are unclear. In this work, polyphenols from red, white, and black peanut skins, which labeled as RPPs, WPPs, and BPPs, were utilized to form complexes with wheat starch (WS). The eGI displayed a downward trend after complexation, with specific values of 79.9, 77.4, and 76.9 for WS-RPPs, WS-WPPs, and WS-BPPs, respectively. The content of the short-range ordered structure showed an increase. And the total crystallinity also increased and sequenced as WS-BPPs (3.91\u00a0%)\u00a0>\u00a0WS-RPPs (3.45\u00a0%)\u00a0>\u00a0WS-WPPs (3.44\u00a0%). Meanwhile, PPs released during digestion suppressed the \u03b1-amylase activity. The correlation and stepwise regression analyses unveiled that enzyme inhibitory activity of released PPs was key to the indigestibility of WS-PPs complexes. This work provides new insights into the association among ordered structures, enzyme inhibitory activity, and starch digestion resistance.",
