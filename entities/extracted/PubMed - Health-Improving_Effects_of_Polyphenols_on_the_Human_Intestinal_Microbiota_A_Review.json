  "title": "Health-Improving Effects of Polyphenols on the Human Intestinal Microbiota: A Review.",
  "abstract": "Dietary polyphenols are garnering attention in the scientific community due to their potential health-beneficial properties and preventative effects against chronic diseases, viz. cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Polyphenols are antioxidants that change microbial composition by suppressing pathogenic bacteria and stimulating beneficial bacteria. The interaction of polyphenols with dietary fibers affects their bioaccessibility in the upper and lower parts of the digestive tract. Dietary fibers, polyphenols, their conjugates, and their metabolites modulate microbiome population and diversity. Consuming polyphenol-rich dietary fibers such as pomegranate, cranberry, berries, and tea improves gut health. A complex relationship exists between polyphenol-rich diets and gut microbiota for functioning in human health. In this review, we provide an overview of the interactions of dietary polyphenols, fibers, and gut microbiota, improving the understanding of the functional properties of dietary polyphenols.",
