  "abstract": "In order to discover novel fungicides from natural products, the phytochemical investigation ofThermopsis lanceolataseeds was thoroughly conducted. Eight new isoflavone derivatives (1-5and8-10), two new stilbenes (6and7), as well as 21 known isoflavones (11-31) were obtained from the crude extract ofT. lanceolataseeds following a bioassay-guided method. The structures of1-31were confirmed via HRESIMS, NMR, IR, UV, and quantum chemistry calculations. The antifungal activities of1-31againstPhytophthora nicotiana,Colletotrichum orbiculare,Rhizoctonia solani, andBotrytis cinereawere screened according to the mycelial inhibition test. Compound6displayed significant antifungal activity againstB. cinereain vitro (EC50: 9.68 \u03bcg/mL) and had an 8 5.7% prevention and control effect in vivo (100 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, antifungal mechanism studies revealed that6causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, increases the level of lipid peroxidation, decreases the activity of MDH, and finally triggers molecular damage and cell death in vitro. Therefore,6can be utilized as a lead compound for novel fungicides.",
