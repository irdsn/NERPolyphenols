  "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED), a prevalent form of male sexual dysfunction, is predominantly treated with Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is). Our previous research highlighted procyanidin, a natural compound, as a notably effective PDE5I. In the current study, we intend to further validate the inhibitory activity of procyanidin on PDE5A through in vitro and in vivo assessments. This study aims to validate the efficacy of procyanidin as a treatment for ED.",
