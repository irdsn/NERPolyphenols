  "abstract": "Agarwood is a highly valued resinous wood typically formed inAquilaria sinensisas a defensive response to external damage, such as external injury or stress. It has a high market economy value and can be used not only as ornamental art but also for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. During the growth and development ofA. sinensis, the regulation of genes and secondary metabolites is particularly important. However, research on the composition ofA. sinensissecretions following injury remains in its early stages. This study investigates resin secretion byA. sinensisin response to external damage. Results revealed thatA. sinensissecretes a large amount of 2-(2-phenethyl) chromone compounds in response to external damage. Because the chemical structures of these compounds are considerably similar to those of flavonoids, this study compares the two types of compounds from the perspectives of their metabolite chemical structures, biosynthetic pathways, triggered molecular responses, and medicinal value. The analysis of the main chemical components of agarwood and its medicinal value can serve as a foundation for the artificial cultivation of high-quality agarwood in the future.",
