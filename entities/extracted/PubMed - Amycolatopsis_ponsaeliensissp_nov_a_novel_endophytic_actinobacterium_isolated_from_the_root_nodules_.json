  "abstract": "The root nodules ofAlnus glutinosaremain a relatively understudied niche, with poorly described associated microbial communities. In this study, the isolate RTGN1Twas recovered from root nodules collected from Gateshead, UK, and was identified as belonging toAmycolatopsisbased on 16S rRNA gene similarity and phylogenomic placement. This isolate was polyphasically characterized, displaying the ability to grow between 12 and 28\u2009\u00b0C and pH 6 and 8 and exhibiting the genes necessary to produce the polar lipids phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerophosphate, alongside DL-type peptidoglycan, which are diagnostic ofAmycolatopsis. Overall genomic relatedness index values were below the cut-off value for delineating a novel species. As such, it is proposed that RTGN1Tbe recognized as the type strain (=CECT 30870T=CABI 507287T) ofAmycolatopsis ponsaeliensissp. nov. The RTGN1Tisolate was screened usingin silicoandin vitromethods and was found to possess a number of genes and pathways related to secondary metabolite production and plant growth promotion. Such genes may serve as an avenue of future study regarding biotechnological potential and use as a bioinoculant to increase phytoremediation efficiency.",
