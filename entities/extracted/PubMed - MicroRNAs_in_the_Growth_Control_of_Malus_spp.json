  "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) significantly influences plant growth, development, and stress responses. This review summarizes current research on apple miRNA, highlighting its roles in vegetative and reproductive growth, anthocyanin synthesis, and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Like in other species, miR156 is crucial for vegetative phase change and flowering induction in apple, which is vital for reducing the juvenile phase, enhancing fruiting, and boosting productivity. Considering the unique mechanism of miR156 in apple compared to other species, the discussion section focuses specifically on the role of miR156 in apple.",
