  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a malignancy with high incidence and mortality rates worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies due to the limitations of current treatments, including drug resistance and adverse effects. Scutellaria baicalensis, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, contains baicalin and baicalein as its primary bioactive flavonoids, which exhibit notable pharmacological properties such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that baicalin and baicalein show promising antitumor activity in CRC treatment through mechanisms such as scavenging reactive oxygen species, immune regulation, and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and modulation of the gut microenvironment. This study further investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of baicalin and baicalein in CRC, aiming to provide new research perspectives and potential clinical applications for the integration of flavonoid-based compounds from Scutellaria baicalensis in CRC treatment.",
