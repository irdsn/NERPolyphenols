  "abstract": "This study evaluated 32 characteristics related to fruit quality and antioxidant to explore the effects of nano hydrogen water (HW) treatment on dragon fruit. Results showed that HW treatment significantly reduced rot index increase, delayed marketable rate declines, maintained fruit taste, and delayed changes in L*, a*, b*, C* and h in both peel and scaly leaves. It also preserved peel thickness, fruit firmness, and pulp firmness. HW treatment reduced the respiratory rate and maintained cell membrane integrity. Additionally, HW treatment reduced H2O2and O2-.accumulation, and enhanced the activities of SOD, CAT, POD and increased polyphenols, flavonoids levels, leading to improved DPPH scavenging ability, \u2219OH scavenging ability, and total antioxidant capacity. PLSDA and correlation analysis identified 15 key quality and antioxidant characteristics that responded coordinately to HW treatment. This study provides an in-depth comprehensive association evaluation of the impact of HW treatment on fruit quality and antioxidant system.",
