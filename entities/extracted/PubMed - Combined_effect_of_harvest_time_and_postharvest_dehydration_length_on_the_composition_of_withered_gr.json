  "abstract": "Sforzato di Valtellina (Sfursat) is a PDO reinforced red wine produced in Valtellina (northern Italy) from partially withered red grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) cv. Nebbiolo. The present study aimed to evaluate the combined influence of different grape ripeness levels and withering length on the chemical composition, mechanical properties, and phenolic profile of Nebbiolo winegrapes from two Valtellina vineyards. During three consecutive vintages (2019, 2020, and 2021), three different technological binomials have been tested: early harvest/long withering (EL), medium-term harvest/medium-term withering (MM), and late harvest/short withering (LS).",
