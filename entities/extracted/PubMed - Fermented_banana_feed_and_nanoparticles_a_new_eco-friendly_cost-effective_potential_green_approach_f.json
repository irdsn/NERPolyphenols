  "title": "Fermented banana feed and nanoparticles: a new eco-friendly, cost-effective potential green approach for poultry industry.",
  "abstract": "The quest for sustainable, alternative, and cost-effective biofeed resources has been driven by the increasing costs and environmental concerns linked to conventional poultry feed. The banana plant (Musa spp.), traditionally valued for its fruit, is gaining recognition as a versatile and sustainable resource for the livestock and poultry industry. Rich in essential nutrients, fibers, and bioactive compounds, banana by-products enhance animal health, improve digestion, and reduce feed costs. Studies reveal that banana plant have potential as natural growth promoters, prebiotics, and antioxidants, contributing to improved feed efficiency and resilience against diseases. The peel of a banana is a good source of vitamins, crude protein (6-9 %), starch (3 %), total nutritional fiber (43.2-49.7 %), and crude fat (3.8-11 %), making it good source of nutrition for animals and birds. In addition, banana's peels contain flavonoids, tannins, phlobatannins, alkaloids, glycosides, and terpenoids. These compounds have antibacterial, growth promoter, antioxidant, stress reducer, anti-cholesterol, antihypertensive, immunostimulants, and anti-inflammatory properties. The banana plant, which is often regarded as agricultural waste, is rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and essential minerals, making it a valuable feed component. Results from experimental studies showed improved feed conversion efficiency, growth performance, and gut health in poultry fed with fermented banana plant-based diets. Fermentation improves the nutritional quality of banana plant biomass by increasing digestibility, reducing anti-nutritional factors, and enriching it with probiotics and bioactive compounds. The fermented banana had a substantial influence on weight gain and feed consumption in chickens. Banana meal may be used into broiler chicken diets at a maximum of 10 % without negatively impacting productivity. Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ag) produced by the banana plant can be used as an alternate growth-promoting supplement for poultry production. This approach offers environmental advantages by minimizing agricultural waste and encouraging more sustainable poultry production practices. Overall, the available studies highlight the considerable promise of fermented banana plants as a sustainable and environmentally friendly option in poultry feeding, tackling both economic and ecological issues faced by the poultry sector.",
