  "abstract": "Recently, natural biopolymers have increasingly been utilized to stabilize Pickering emulsions (PEs) for food applications. The research and development of marine polysaccharides is one of the hotspots in the field of PEs due to their low-cost, non-toxicity, abundant, and sustainability. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in marine polysaccharide-based stabilized PEs systems. We begin with an introduction to the sources of marine polysaccharides and the methods for fabricating marine polysaccharide-based PEs. Following this, we summarize the role of natural marine polysaccharides and their complexes (combined with other polysaccharides, proteins, polyphenols, fatty acids, or other particles) as particles to form and stabilize PEs. Additionally, we detail the current applications of marine polysaccharide-based PEs in food packaging films/coatings, 3D printing, encapsulation and delivery of functional food ingredients, as well as in fat substitutes. Finally, potential future developments of PEs stabilized by marine polysaccharides in the food industry are also proposed. This review will provide valuable references to promote the application of marine polysaccharide-based PEs in the food sector.",
