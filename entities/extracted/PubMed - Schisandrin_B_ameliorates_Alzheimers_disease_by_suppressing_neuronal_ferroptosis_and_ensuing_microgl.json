  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal damage, with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Inhibition of neuronal ferroptosis has shown promise as a potential treatment for AD. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a major active component of Schisandra chinensis, exhibits potential neuroprotective effects. However, whether Sch B inhibits neuronal ferroptosis remains unclear.",
