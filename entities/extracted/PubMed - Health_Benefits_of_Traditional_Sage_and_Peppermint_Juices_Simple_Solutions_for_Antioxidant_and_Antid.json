  "abstract": "Sage and peppermint leaves and flowers possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic-regulating properties. This study compared the phenolic profiles confirmed using LC-MS/MS analysis and the biological activities of traditionally prepared sage (SJ) and peppermint juices (PJ), evaluating theirex vivoantioxidant enzyme activity and antidiabetic potential in experimental mice. Quinic acid (2571.86 \u00b1 1.15 \u00b5g/g dry weight (d.w.)) and apigenin-7-O-\u03b2-glucoside (324.36 \u00b1 1.15 \u00b5g/g d.w.) were the predominant phenolic compounds in SJ, while PJ contained caffeic acid (16.96 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b5g/g d.w.) and quinic acid (184.27 \u00b1 0.45 \u00b5g/g d.w.). The administration of SJ and PJ for ten days significantly reduced the blood glucose levels of the mice. Compared to the control group, which showed an increase from 15.89 \u00b1 3.45 to 29.54 \u00b1 8.94 mmoL/L, SJ-20 mg/kg body weight (BW)-treated mice exhibited a more moderate rise (16.25 \u00b1 7.33 to 21.50 \u00b1 10.38 mmoL/L). Juice administration also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, with PJ-20 mg/kg BW significantly increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (30.15 \u00b1 3.99 U/mg proteins) compared to the control (18.83 \u00b1 2.04 U/mg proteins). Additionally, catalase (CAT) activity was elevated, indicating enhanced oxidative stress defense mechanisms. Furthermore, treatment with SJ-20 mg/kg BW reduced aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (7025.8 \u00b1 1038.8 to 2782 \u00b1 426.9 IU/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (10679 \u00b1 1409.2 to 5336.5 \u00b1 801.5 IU/L), suggesting hepatoprotective effects. These results support the traditional use of sage and peppermint juices as functional beverages with antioxidant, antidiabetic, and hepatoprotective properties, warranting further clinical investigation.",
