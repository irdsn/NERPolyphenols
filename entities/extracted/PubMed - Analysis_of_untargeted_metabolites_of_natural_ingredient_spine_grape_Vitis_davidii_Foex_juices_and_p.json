  "abstract": "Consumer demand for natural products is driving innovation in clean label ingredients. Spine grape (Vitis davidii Foex), a wild East Asian species, and its fresh juice show great promise as versatile ingredients because of their rich composition. The present study assessed the physicochemical properties and metabolite profiles of fresh juices from four spine grape cultivars, exploring their application.",
