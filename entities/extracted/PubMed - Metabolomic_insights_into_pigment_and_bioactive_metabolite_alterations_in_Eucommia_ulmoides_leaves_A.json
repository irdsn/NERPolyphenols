  "abstract": "Eucommia ulmoides (EU), an endemic Chinese plant, faces challenges of weak germplasm resources and low genetic diversity. Carbon ion beam irradiation (CIBI) was used to develop a novel EU variety with enhanced traits, particularly in leaf composition. The new variety exhibited elongated leaves with distinct pigmentation and increased anthocyanin accumulation. Metabolomic profiling identified 688 polyphenols, with 314 significantly altered, including upregulated antioxidants like morin and Chrysin-7-O-glucoside. Anthocyanin and carotenoid analyses revealed unique compounds, such as Cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside and lutein caprate. TCMSP database analysis identified 48 bioactive compounds, 23 with high oral bioavailability, supporting antioxidant and lipid-regulating effects. This study highlights the novel EU variety's potential as a sustainable functional food source, expanding its applications beyond bark utilization.",
