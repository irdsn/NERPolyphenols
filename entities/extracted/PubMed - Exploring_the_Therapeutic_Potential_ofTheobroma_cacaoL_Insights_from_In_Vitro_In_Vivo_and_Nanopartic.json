  "abstract": "Theobroma cacaoL., commonly known as cocoa, has been an integral part of human culture and diet for thousands of years. However, recent scientific research has highlighted its potential therapeutic properties, particularly in the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. This comprehensive review analyzes the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects ofTheobroma cacaoextracts combined with nanoparticles using in vitro and in vivo studies. Its diverse biological activity can be attributed to its rich phytochemical profile, including polyphenols, flavonoids, and alkaloids. In vitro studies have found that cocoa extracts, alone or in combination with nanoparticles, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and modulate key signaling pathways in various cancer cell lines. The extracts have also been found to reduce tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, potentially reducing their side effects, in vivo. Its anti-inflammatory properties are based on its ability to modulate inflammatory mediators, inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling, and regulate macrophage polarization. These effects have been observed in both cellular and animal models of inflammation. This review opens up new possibilities for future research and therapeutic applications, highlighting the potential ofTheobroma cacaoas a valuable complementary approach in the treatment and prevention of cancer and inflammatory diseases.",
