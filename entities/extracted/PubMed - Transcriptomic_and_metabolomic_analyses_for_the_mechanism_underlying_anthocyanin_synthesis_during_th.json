  "abstract": "Purple eggplant (Solanum melongenaL.) is valued for its high anthocyanin content, yet the regulatory mechanisms driving anthocyanin biosynthesis during fruit development remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the dynamics of anthocyanin accumulation and identify key regulatory genes across three developmental stages of eggplant fruit peel (S1: white, S2: light purple, S3: dark purple).",
