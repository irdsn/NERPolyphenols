  "abstract": "The main objective for diabetic wound treatment is the design of a functional dressing that scavenges free radicals, alleviates inflammation, and is antibacterial while promoting neovascularization. Herein, a multifunctional acellular matrix hydrogel was prepared with the antimicrobial peptide jelleine-1 and a magnesium ion/gallic acid metal framework to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and proangiogenesis effects in diabetic wounds. The prepared hydrogel termed Gel-J-MOF efficiently released gallic acid in the acidic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, scavenged excess free radicals in vitro, and effectively reduced the levels of inflammation by regulating M2 macrophage polarization in vivo. The antimicrobial peptide jelleine-1 in the composite hydrogel effectively inhibitedS. aureusandE. coliin vitro, promoting a suitable microenvironment for wound healing. In the later stage of wound healing, the composite hydrogel stimulated angiogenesis, accelerating the re-epithelialization and collagen deposition in the wound. In conclusion, this multifunctional composite hydrogel provides a regulated microenvironment for treating diabetic wounds and, therefore, has significant potential application promise in the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds.",
