  "abstract": "Procyanidins are one of the polyphenols consisting of multiple flavan-3-ols (eg epicatechin). They have a complex chemical structure, with the degree of polymerization and linked position of flavan-3-ols varying among various foods, such as apples and chocolate. Physiological functional studies of procyanidins have investigated their mechanisms in cells and animals based on their antioxidant effects. Recently, the intestinal environment, including the intestinal microflora, has played an important role in the energy metabolism and health status of the host. Regulation of the intestinal environment by dietary polyphenols is becoming a new concept in health functions, and we have begun to investigate the mechanism of apple procyanidins, focusing on the gut microbiota and metabolites in our functional research. In this minireview, we will discuss the effects of procyanidin ingestion on the gut microbiota and metabolites.",
