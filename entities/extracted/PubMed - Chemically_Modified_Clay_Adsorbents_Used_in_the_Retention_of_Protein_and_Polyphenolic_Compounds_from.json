  "abstract": "During the manufacturing process of white wine, various physicochemical reactions can occur and can affect the quality of the finished product. For this reason, it is necessary to apply different treatments to minimize distinct factors such as protein instability and pinking phenomenon, which can affect the organoleptic properties of wines and their structure. In this work, a new method for the preparation of a sorbent-type material is presented through the fractional purification of native bentonite in three fractions (Na-BtF1, Na-BtF2, and Na-BtF3). Furthermore, the influence of the prepared sorbents on pH, conductivity, and amino nitrogen level was analyzed. The absorbents prepared and tested in wine solutions were characterized using the following physico-chemical methods: Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BET-BJH) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, and transform-coupled infrared spectroscopy Fourier with attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR). Following the analyses carried out on the retention of protein content and polyphenolic compounds, it was found that materials based on natural clay have suitable adsorption properties.",
