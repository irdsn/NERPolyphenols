  "abstract": "The current approach to obesity care, which primarily focuses on weight loss, is often insufficient because of the challenges in maintaining long-term results. Therefore, novel, safe, and sustainable medications for obesity are highly anticipated. Taxifolin, a natural bioactive flavonoid, was found to exert pleiotropic protective effects against various diseases. Our experimentalin vivoandin vitrostudies revealed that taxifolin administration contributes to weight loss. Accordingly, we hypothesized that long-term oral intake of taxifolin was clinically associated with weight loss.",
