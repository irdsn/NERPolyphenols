  "abstract": "Liquid whole egg (LWE) is increasingly popular for its convenience in food preparation. While pasteurization ensures safety, it often impairs LWE's functional properties. High pressure processing (HP) is a non-thermal preservation method that maintains product quality and nutrition. Green tea extracts (GTE) are rich in polyphenols, offering antioxidant and antimicrobial benefits, and can enhance LWE's properties. This study examines the effects of combining GTE and HP on LWE's rheological, foaming, and emulsifying properties using response surface methodology to optimize HP conditions. HP with GTE improved foaming ability and stability by 21\u00a0% and 23\u00a0%, and emulsifying ability and stability by 41\u00a0% and 26\u00a0%, respectively, compared to raw LWE. Conventional pasteurization (60\u00a0\u00b0C, 3.5\u00a0min) reduced these properties by 2\u00a0%, 10\u00a0%, 5\u00a0%, and 0.1\u00a0%, respectively. GTE fortification maintained or improved these properties under both treatments. All LWE samples exhibited pseudoplastic flow behavior, with HP reducing yield stress and flow behavior index, increasing consistency.",
