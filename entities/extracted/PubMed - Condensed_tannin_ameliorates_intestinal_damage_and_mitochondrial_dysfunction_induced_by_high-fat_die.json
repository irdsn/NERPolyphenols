  "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of condensed tannin (CT) supplementation on the intestinal health and mitochondrial function in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fed a high-fat diet. Six experimental diets were formulated, comprising three lipid levels in the diets (10\u00a0%, 15\u00a0%, and 20\u00a0%) with or without 3.75\u00a0g/kg CT supplementation. The largemouth bass were fed those diets for 56\u00a0days. Results demonstrated that a dietary lipid content of 20\u00a0% had a detrimental impact on the growth, intestinal health, and mitochondrial function of largemouth bass. However, the adverse effects of high dietary lipid levels were mitigated by incorporating of CT. This mitigation may be ascribed to the ability of CT to improve the intestinal barrier (claudin-1, claudin-4, and zo-1), increase the abundance of beneficial intestines microbe, and enhance intestinal antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, CT promoted mitochondrial biogenesis (pgc-1\u03b1, nrf1, and ampk-\u03b1), maintained the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion, increased ATP content, and enhanced the activity of mitochondrial complexes II, IV, and V. In conclusion, CT preserved intestinal health and function while boosting mitochondrial function, thereby facilitating the growth of largemouth bass.",
