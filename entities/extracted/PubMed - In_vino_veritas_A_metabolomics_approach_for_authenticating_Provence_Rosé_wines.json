  "abstract": "Provence ros\u00e9 wines have gained global popularity, making them vulnerable to fraud. This study aimed to identify specific chemical markers to detect counterfeit Provence ros\u00e9 wines. An untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics analysis was performed on a set of 30 wines classified as \"Provence,\" \"Non-Provence,\" and \"Provence imitations.\" Using the Molnotator workflow, 1300 potential metabolites were generated, and five key chemomarkers were selected through a machine learning pipeline. Further targeted analysis and bioinformatics using in silico MS/MS fragmentation systems confidently annotated three specific chemomarkers for \"Provence\" ros\u00e9: acuminoside, tetrahydroxydimethoxyflavone, and 5'-methoxycastavinol. A composite score using a PLS model combining the 3 chemomarkers effectively distinguished authentic wines, with high accuracy (sensitivity 83.3\u00a0%, specificity 100\u00a0%, accuracy 93.3\u00a0%).",
