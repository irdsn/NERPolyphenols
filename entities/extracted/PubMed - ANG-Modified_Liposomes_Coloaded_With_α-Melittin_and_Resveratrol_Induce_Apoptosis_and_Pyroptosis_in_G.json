  "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the most prevalent and devastating types of brain cancer for which efficient treatments are currently lacking because of limitations such as antitumor efficacy, brain delivery, tumor selectivity, and drug resistance. A promising strategy to overcome these obstacles is developing anticancer agents that can be delivered to GB tissues to inhibit tumors with low toxicity to normal brain tissue.",
