  "title": "Insights into the mechanisms and regulatory strategies for aroma profiles and browning phenomena in banana puree processing.",
  "abstract": "Banana puree, which serves as a vital intermediate raw material in the production of banana-based products, is prone to browning and aroma loss during the processing stage. This study focuses on elucidating the patterns of browning and aroma loss and investigating the mechanisms behind these phenomena, using Cavendish banana and Pisang Awak banana as subjects. The results showed that Cavendish banana exhibited superior processing suitability in terms of flavor. Through untargeted metabolomics analysis, it was found that the homogenization process affects aroma synthesis and browning pathways, particularly \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism. Targeted metabolomics analysis further identified that the synergistic effect of multiple phenolic substances plays a crucial role in banana browning. Additionally, research indicated that adding 0.5\u00a0% cinnamic acid could effectively delay the browning of banana puree and enhance overall flavor quality by inhibiting lipoxygenase activity. This study offers a theoretical foundation for addressing bottleneck issues in the banana processing industry.",
