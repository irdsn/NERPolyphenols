  "abstract": "The technology and digestive characteristics of honeysuckle beverages fermented byLactobacillus acidophiluswere researched, the digestive characteristics were evaluated by simulating the gastrointestinal digestive systemin vitro. The optimum conditions were as follows: fermentation temperature, 35\u00b0C; fermentation time, 19\u202fh; and inoculation amount, 3%. Fermented honeysuckle beverages had greater antioxidant and\u03b1-glucosidase inhibition capacities than unfermented beverages after digestion. The bioavailabilities of total phenol, total flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in fermented honeysuckle liquid were 29.72, 21.80, and 36.93%, respectively, whereas those in unfermented honeysuckle liquid were 22.03, 17.28, and 25.67%, respectively. The pH of the fermented honeysuckle beverage remained relatively stable during storage at 4\u00b0C, with no significant change (p>\u202f0.05). The number of viable bacteria decreased from 9.79 lg CFU/mL to 8.31 lg CFU/mL, and the sensory score and color decreased. This study provides a reference basis for the development of honeysuckle products and specific functional probiotic products.",
