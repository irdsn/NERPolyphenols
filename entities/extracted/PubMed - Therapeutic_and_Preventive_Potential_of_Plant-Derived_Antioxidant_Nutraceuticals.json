  "abstract": "Oxidative stress and its relation to the onset of several chronic diseases have been increasingly highlighted in recent years. In parallel, there has been an increasing interest in the antioxidant properties of phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are products of plant secondary metabolism, including structural polysaccharides, unsaturated fatty acids, pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins), or phenolic compounds. Phytochemicals can be obtained from lower and higher plants, their fruits, and even from macro- or microalgae. Their diverse structural features are linked to different beneficial effects through various molecular mechanisms, contributing to disease prevention. Beyond antioxidant activity, many phytochemicals also display anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, and neuroprotective effects, which can be intertwined. Beyond these, other natural antioxidants can also be obtained from animal, fungal, and bacterial sources. Thus, a wide range of antioxidants have the potential to be used as nutraceuticals with chemopreventive effects on the onset of various diseases related to antioxidant stress. Given their enormous structural and sourcing diversity, the present work provides an updated insight into the therapeutic and preventive potential of plant-derived antioxidants and nutraceuticals.",
