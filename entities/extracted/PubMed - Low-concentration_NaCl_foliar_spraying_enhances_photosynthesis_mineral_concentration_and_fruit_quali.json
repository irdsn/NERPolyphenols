  "abstract": "Root-applied low-concentration NaCl (e.g., 40 mM) has been shown to maintain the yield and enhance both nutritional and functional quality in salt-sensitive strawberry cultivars. However, the potential benefits of foliar low-concentration NaCl application on strawberry plants have rarely been investigated to avoid secondary soil salinization through long-term root application, especially the effects on fruit quality during greenhouse high-temperature periods.",
