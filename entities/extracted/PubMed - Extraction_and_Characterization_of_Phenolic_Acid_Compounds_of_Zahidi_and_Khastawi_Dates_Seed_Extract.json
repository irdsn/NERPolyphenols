  "abstract": "The date fruit is a remarkable source of nutraceuticals and bioactive compounds. Different types of phenolic compounds with high antioxidant capacity are found in date seed extract. Additionally, these compounds can be potential antibacterial agents to combat antibiotic resistance strains. Therefore, the main idea of the current study was to quantify five key phenolic acids in the ethanolic extract of Zahidi and Khastawi dates seed and to examine their antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA).",
