  "title": "Novel Nanoformulations to Overcome Obstacles in Herbal Drug Delivery for Alzheimer's Disease.",
  "abstract": "Nanomedicine is a rapidly growing field in pharmaceutical science, driven by the enhanced quality of nano-formulations that improve the treatment of various diseases. Nano-sized novel drug delivery techniques for herbal pharmaceuticals have the potential to enhance activity and address concerns related to medicinal plants in the future. Natural chemicals show promise in various neurodegenerative diseases, but their permeability across the blood-brain barrier prevents them from reaching the nervous system. By improving molecular monitoring, synthesis, and diagnostics, pharmaceutical nanotechnology provides improved controlled drug delivery for the treatment of neurodegeneration.",
