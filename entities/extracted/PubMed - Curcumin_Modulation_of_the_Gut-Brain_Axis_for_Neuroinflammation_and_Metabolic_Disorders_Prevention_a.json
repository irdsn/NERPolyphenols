  "abstract": "Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa, has gained significant attention for its potential therapeutic benefits, particularly counteracting inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Its chemical structure, featuring conjugated double bonds between two aromatic rings, allows it to act as an electron donor, thereby mitigating free radical formation. Despite its poor solubility in water, curcumin is stable in acidic environments and undergoes significant metabolism in both the liver and the gut. Intestinal microbiota, particularly at the colon level, further metabolizes curcumin into several derivatives, including dihydrocurcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin, which exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies suggest that curcumin can reduce body mass index (BMI) and improve other body composition parameters, especially when used in combination with lifestyle changes, though its bioavailability is low due to its rapid metabolism and the resulting low blood concentration. In obesity, dysfunctional adipose tissue remodeling and chronic inflammation play critical roles in the development of metabolic complications. Curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties are related to the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway, leading to the reduction in inflammatory markers in adipocytes and macrophages. Additionally, curcumin modulates oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 pathway, enhancing cellular antioxidant defenses. Emerging evidence also supports curcumin's potential in improving gut health by modulating microbiota composition, enhancing intestinal barrier function, and reducing systemic inflammation. This interaction with the gut-brain axis highlights the broader implications of curcumin in neuroprotection, as it positively affects cognitive function and mitigates neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. disease. Thus, curcumin holds promise as a multifaceted agent in the management of obesity and associated diseases.",
