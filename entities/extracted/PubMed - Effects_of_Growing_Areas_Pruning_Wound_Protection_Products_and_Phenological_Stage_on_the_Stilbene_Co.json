  "abstract": "Applying plant protection products (PPP) on grapevine pruning wounds is a viticultural practice used to mitigate the spread of grapevine tuck disease, which is posing serious economic losses in the vine-wine industry. However, the impact of PPP on woody tissues remains unclear. Our study, conducted in two European vineyards, investigated the effects of Cuprocol, Tessior, Esquive, and Bentogran on stilbenes, in canes of Cabernet sauvignon and Syrah, at three phenological stages. Main stilbenes, quantified by HPLC-UV-DAD (1260 Agilent Infinity System) and identified by HPLC-ESI/MS (Thermo Scientific LCQ FLEET system), included E-resveratrol, E-\u03b5-viniferin, E-piceatannol, and E-polydatin. Canes exhibited varying proportions of individual stilbenes, reflecting differences based on climatic conditions and phenological phases, rather than on the application of specific PPP. Vines grown in cool-climate conditions exhibited higher levels of E-resveratrol, whereas vines from the Mediterranean climate area exhibited higher levels of E-\u03b5-viniferin. We also observed divergences in the accumulation trend of wood stilbenes throughout the season in canes collected in the two different growing areas.",
