  "title": "Bioactive microfiber yarns serving as sutures with antibacterial and pro-tissue repair capabilities.",
  "abstract": "A novel class of biofunctional hydrogel-coated microfiber yarns was developed to serve as bioactive sutures for wound closure and tissue regeneration. The microfibrous sutures exhibited remarkable antibacterial and pro-tissue repair capabilities, attributed to their distinctive crosslinking strategy. This strategy involves using PVA, quercetin, and tannic acid to impart exceptional hydrophilicity to the sutures.",
