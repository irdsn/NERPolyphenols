  "abstract": "Zinc deficiency is a global health issue, and agronomic biofortification is a promising strategy to enhance the bioaccessibility of Zn in edible crops. Microgreens, with their short growth cycle, high nutrient-density, and low antinutrient content, are ideal candidates for Zn-enrichment via fertigation. While controlled environments allow light modulation to optimize yield and quality, limited information exists on how Zn-enrichment and light together influence metabolite biosynthesis. This study evaluated metabolic responses in radish microgreens grown under varying Zn (0-15 mg/L) and light intensity (100-400 \u03bcmol/m2/s) levels using targeted metabolomics. High light intensity increased flavonoid and phenolic-acid levels, suggesting enhanced antioxidant responses, while reducing amino acids and glucosinolates, indicating a resource shift toward stress mitigation. Zn enrichment modulated phenylpropanoid, nitrogen, and energy metabolism, increasing specific flavonoids, phenolic acids, essential amino acids, and ATP. These findings provide insights into optimizing Zn- and light inputs to produce biofortified, nutrient-rich microgreens with improved functional-food potential.",
