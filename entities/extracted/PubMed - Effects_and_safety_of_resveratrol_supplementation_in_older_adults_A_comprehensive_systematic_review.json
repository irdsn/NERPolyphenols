  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential benefits against chronic diseases. However, its effects and safety in older adults have not been comprehensively studied. This study aimed to determine the effects and safety of RSV supplementation in older adults. MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched for eligible studies. Studies were enrolled if they were randomized clinical trials and had incorporated RSV supplementation for older adults. Two independent authors conducted the literature search, and eligibility was determined according to the PICOS framework. Study details, intervention specifics, and relevant outcomes were collected during the data collection. The Cochrane RoB-2 tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. This review included 10 studies. The combination of RSV and exercise improved exercise adaptation and muscle function in healthy older adults and physical performance and mobility measures in individuals with functional limitations. RSV showed potential neuroprotective effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In overweight individuals, RSV demonstrated a positive impact on cognitive function, but it increased some biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk at high doses. In older adults with diabetes and those with peripheral artery disease (PAD), RSV was not more effective than placebo. No study reported significant adverse events following RSV treatment. RSV can improve various health parameters in age-related health conditions. However, the optimal dosage, long-term effects, and potential interactions with medications still need to be investigated through well-designed RCTs.",
