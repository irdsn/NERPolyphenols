  "abstract": "Dysbiosis of gut microbiome is one of the most important factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intake of phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables is an effective way to improve IBD, but how these bioactivators regulate gut microbiota to exert healthy effects remains unclear. Here, we found that pretreatment with CiLi juice, particularly its polyphenol component, alleviated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis while preserving intestinal barrier integrity. CiLi polyphenols (CL_PP) reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in colon tissue and enriched fecal short-chain fatty acids. Importantly, CL_PP significantly regulated the gut microbiome diversity, increasing beneficial bacteria (e.g., Clostridia_UCG-014, f_Muribaculaceae and Ileibacterium_valens) while decreasing harmful bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Romboutsia). Multiomics analysis revealed that CL_PP upregulated bioactive lipid metabolites, particularly those derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., resolvin D2, prostaglandin A1, and glycerophosphocholine) related gene expressions (Pltp, Alox15 and Pld4). Additionally, CL-PP downregulated the oxidative stress markers (oxidized glutathione and glutathione peroxidase 3), and immune cell markers (CD8 and CD68). Fecal microbiota transplantation confirmed that the fecal microbiota from CL_PP-treated mice exhibited anti-colitis effects. These effects were diminished in antibiotic-treated mice, underscoring the importance of the gut microbiota in mediating the CL_PP's anti-inflammatory benefits. This study suggests that CL_PP is a potential modulator of gut microbiome dysbiosis for the prevention and treatment of colitis.",
