  "abstract": "Cisplatin, a widely used therapy for solid tumors, is associated with hepatotoxicity characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization of liver cells, sinusoidal congestion, mononuclear and Kupffer cell infiltration, and focal necrosis. Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) leaves, rich in flavonoids with antioxidant properties, may mitigate hepatotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ethanol extract of M. oleifera leaves on inflammation, oxidative stress, and liver cell damage in a rat model of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity.",
