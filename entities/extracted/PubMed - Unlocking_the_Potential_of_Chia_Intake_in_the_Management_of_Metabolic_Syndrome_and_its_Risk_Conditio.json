  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is the occurrence of at least three of the five conditions diabetes, overweight and obesity, triglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Dietary interventions have been one of the first lines of treatment indicated for improving conditions related to metabolic syndrome. The growing interest in plant-based diets and foods with health-promoting qualities has increased significantly. Due to its excellent nutritional and bioactive value, chia seeds have a significant market share, characterized by their high content of proteins, essential fatty acids, fiber, vitamins, minerals, phenolic compounds, and antioxidants. These constituents promote potential positive effects on improving health, especially blood pressure, and reducing oxidative stress and the inflammatory state installed by metabolic syndrome and its risk conditions. However, the ten studies in humans that were reviewed generally showed no effect on anthropometric parameters and biochemical parameters related to glucose and lipid homeostasis. Thus, although chia seeds have a high potential to combat metabolic syndrome, this review found few studies, highlighting a gap in the area and a possible future topic for researchers.",
