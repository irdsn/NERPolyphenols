  "abstract": "Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) exposure has been linked to neurotoxicity in various animal models, presenting significant concern to human health due to its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases. Aluminum chloride is a widely recognized neurotoxin and has been used as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease via mechanisms linked with oxidative stress and inflammation. The study investigated the potential ameliorative effect of apigenin on AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity in rats.",
