  "abstract": "Oligostilbenes, which have been associated with multiple biological activities, are a kind of oligomeric resveratrol compound and widely exist in Paeonia seeds threshing residues. The re-use of the Paeonia seeds threshing residues as value-added materials is, not only cost-effective, but also environmentally beneficial. It is therefore important to develop a high-efficiency method for extraction of oligostilbenes.",
