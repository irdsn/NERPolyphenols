  "abstract": "Tamoxifen is guideline treatment for premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Therapeutic efficacy relies partly on tamoxifen biotransformation by CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzymes. We conducted a cohort study to evaluate whether concomitant prescription of drugs that inhibit these enzymes impacted breast cancer recurrence.",
