  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent joint inflammation and systemic immune dysregulation. The current pharmacological treatments, primarily synthetic drugs, often present adverse effects and long-term toxicity. This study explores the therapeutic potential ofCoprinus comatusnanogels as a novel herbal formulation with antiarthritic and anti-inflammatory properties in a Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced rat model of RA. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy ofC. comatusnanogels in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, antibody production, paw edema, and arthritis indices and to assess their potential as a safer alternative to conventional RA therapies.",
