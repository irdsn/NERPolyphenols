  "abstract": "Modifying the structure of natural emulsifiers can significantly alter their bulk properties and interfacial behavior. In this study, the binding mechanisms and interfacial adsorption of octenyl succinic anhydride starch (OSA-starch)/ epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) complexes were investigated for developing functional emulsifiers. Molecular dynamics simulations and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that OSA-starch and EGCG interacted via van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. With EGCG concentrations increased from 0.05\u00a0% to 0.20\u00a0%, the number of hydrogen bonds between OSA-starch and EGCG changed from 8 to 26. The improved oil-water interfacial properties were evidenced by contact angle measurements and dynamic interfacial tension analysis. Specifically, when EGCG concentration was 0.05\u00a0%, the contact angle of the OSA-starch/EGCG complexes was increased to 71.29\u00b0, while the interfacial diffusion rate was rose to 0.0252 mN m-1s-1/2. The structural features and interfacial behaviors of OSA-starch/EGCG complexes were closely interconnected, offering significant insights into the regulation of interfaces.",
