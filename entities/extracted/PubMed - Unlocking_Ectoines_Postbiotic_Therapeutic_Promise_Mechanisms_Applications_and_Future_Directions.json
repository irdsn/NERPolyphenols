  "abstract": "Ectoine, a cytoprotective compound derived from bacteria and categorized as a postbiotic, is increasingly recognized as a viable alternative to traditional therapeutic agents, frequently presenting considerable side effects. This extensive review underscores the effectiveness of ectoine as a postbiotic in managing conditions such as rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis, all while demonstrating a commendable safety profile. Its capacity to establish robust hydrogen bonds without compromising cellular integrity supports its potential application in anti-aging and cancer prevention strategies. Recent studies have clarified ectoine's function in alleviating oxidative stress caused by environmental pollutants and ultraviolet radiation, broadening its advantages for skin and ecological health. The review details ectoine's mechanisms of action, which include the protection of cellular macromolecules, modulation of inflammation, and prevention of apoptosis, while also highlighting emerging research that positions ectoine as a promising postbiotic candidate for therapeutic strategies in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune conditions, and metabolic syndromes. Additionally, the review addresses challenges such as the low bioavailability of ectoine in eukaryotic cells, the constraints on scalability for industrial production, and the high costs associated with synthetic biology methods. Future prospects for ectoine as a postbiotic therapeutic option are also discussed, including the potential for advanced delivery systems, such as ectoine-loaded nanoparticles and hydrogels, to improve stability and bioavailability, as well as synergistic combinations with phytochemicals like resveratrol and curcumin to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Integrating artificial intelligence into ectoine research revolutionizes understanding its therapeutic properties, streamlining drug formulation and clinical applications. By synthesizing insights into ectoine's molecular mechanisms and investigating new therapeutic pathways, this review advocates for advancing ectoine as a natural postbiotic therapeutic agent, addressing contemporary health challenges while meeting the growing demand for safer alternatives.",
