  "abstract": "The Siddha system of medicine uses natural herbal products for the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus (DM). In Northern Province, Sri Lanka Madhumeha chooranam, Neerizhivu chooranam 1 and Neerizhivu chooranam 2 are famously used ones among the most prioritized drugs for DM. Therefore, this study aimed to formulate the crude drug, evaluate the physical properties, physiochemical properties and phytochemical screening of crude drugs as it is necessary to standardize this formulation for the safety of the stakeholders. Plant materials were collected in Jaffna and powdered. Madhumeha chooranam, Neerizhivu chooranam 1 and Neerizhivu chooranam 2 were prepared using siddha literature. Organoleptic properties, physical and physiochemical parameters were evaluated for the crude drug. The crude drug was macerated with methanol separately for 48 hours at room temperature and phytochemical were analysed for each crude extracts. The results of physical and physiochemical were analysed with one-way ANOVA using SPSS 23. All three drugs showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, carbohydrates, reducing sugars, tannins, steroids, proteins, amino acids, glycosides, phenol, terpenoids and anthraquinones. The results of physical and physiochemical parameters were confirned and can be used for setting standards for the selected drugs Madhumeha chooranam, Neerizhivu chooranam 1, and Neerizhivu chooranam 2.",
