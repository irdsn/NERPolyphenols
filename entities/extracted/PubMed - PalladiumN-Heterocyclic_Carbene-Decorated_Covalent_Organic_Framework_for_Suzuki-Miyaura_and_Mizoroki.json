  "abstract": "Recently, significant breakthroughs have been achieved in covalent organic frameworks (COF) as well-defined porous materials for palladium catalysis. However, the development of modular frameworks decorated with readily available and strongly \u03c3-donating N-heterocyclic ligands is unexplored. In this study, we report a novel modular Pd-NHC/COF framework, where the active palladium species is incorporated into a covalent organic framework (COF) through readily accessible benzimidazolium. The Pd-NHC/COF system promotes the Suzuki-Miyaura and Mizoroki-Heck C-C cross-coupling as a highly active reusable catalyst. Excellent catalytic efficiency and highZ/Eselectivity have been achieved for the construction of biaryls and stilbenes using this Pd-NHC/COF catalytic system.",
