  "abstract": "Microalgae offer a sustainable and versatile source of bioactive compounds. Their rapid growth, efficient CO2utilization, and adaptability make them a promising alternative to traditional production methods. Key compounds, such as proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), polyphenols, phytosterols, pigments, and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), hold significant commercial value and are widely utilized in food, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, driving innovation across multiple industries. Their antiviral and enzyme-producing capabilities further enhance industrial and medical applications. Additionally, microalgae-based biostimulants and plant elicitor peptides (PEPs) contribute to sustainable agriculture by enhancing plant growth and resilience to environmental stressors. The GRAS status of several species facilitates market integration, but challenges in scaling and cost reduction remain. Advances in biotechnology and metabolic engineering will optimize production, driving growth in the global microalgae industry. With increasing consumer demand for natural, eco-friendly products, microalgae will play a vital role in health, food security, and environmental sustainability.",
