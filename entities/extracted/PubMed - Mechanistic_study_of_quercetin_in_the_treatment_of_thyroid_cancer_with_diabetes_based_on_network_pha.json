  "abstract": "Thyroid cancer (TC) stands as a prevalent malignancy within the global endocrine system, with its incidence notably exacerbated by the presence of diabetes. However, the specific relationship between TC and diabetes and promising treatment strategies that address both conditions simultaneously are still under exploration. Quercetin, herb medicine from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is widely used as an adjunctive therapy with Western medicine in the treatment of many diseases based on a wide range of biological effects. The objective of this study was to explore the efficacy of quercetin in treating TC with diabetes combining bioinformatics and network pharmacology.",
