  "abstract": "This study investigated the metabolic changes occurring during the ripening of Campomanesia pubescens fruits using metabolomics and proteomics approaches. Two alkaloids and nine phenolic compounds were identified, with emphasis on trigonelline and gallic acid. Proteomic analysis revealed 940 proteins, of which 452 showed differential expression, reflecting physiological changes, such as the reduced expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, indicating low photosynthetic activity and the transition from chloroplasts to chromoplasts. The intensification of glycolysis was suggested by the increased expression of phosphoglycerate kinase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. The activation of enzymes of the phenolic compound pathway, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and O-methyltransferase, indicated the accumulation of secondary metabolites essential for fruit defense and nutritional quality. The expression of enzymes in the ethylene pathway, such as SAM synthase, suggested their role in gabiroba ripening. The results highlight the interaction of metabolic pathways during fruit ripening.",
