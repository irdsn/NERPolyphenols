  "abstract": "This study presents the first analysis of the polyphenolic profile and evaluation of antioxidant and anti-corrosive properties of the methanolic extract fromFerula longipesCoss. ex Bonn. & Maury. Using LC-MS/MS, significant bioactive compounds were identified, notably including quercetin-3-D-xyloside (643.10\u2009mg/g),trans-ferulic acid (632.05\u2009mg/g), quercetin-3-glucoside (425.74\u2009mg/g), and -hyperoside (310.21\u2009mg/g). Total polyphenol content reached 111.94\u2009\u00b1\u20091.63\u2009\u00b5g GAE/mg extract, and total flavonoid content was 47.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.077\u2009\u00b5g QE/mg extract. Antioxidant activity was assessed using DPPH\u2022 radical scavenging, ABTS\u2022+ radical cation scavenging, FRAP, phenanthroline, and SNP assays. Notable IC50values were observed for DPPH\u2022 scavenging (247.13\u2009\u00b1\u20093.76\u2009\u00b5g/mL), ABTS\u2022+ scavenging (120.57\u2009\u00b1\u20092.60\u2009\u00b5g/mL), and in the phenanthroline assay (84.07\u2009\u00b1\u20091.28\u2009\u00b5g/mL), although lower efficacy was noted in the FRAP and SNP assays compared to standards (Trolox and ascorbic acid). The extract also demonstrated high anti-corrosive efficiency, achieving inhibition rates of 91.2% for aluminium, 82.7% for steel, and 72.3% for zinc electrodes in 0.5\u2009M HCl. This protection is attributed to the adsorption of phytochemicals onto the metal surfaces, forming a protective interfacial layer. These findings highlight the potential ofF. longipesas a natural source of antioxidants and plant-derived, surface-active corrosion inhibitors for potential industrial applications.",
