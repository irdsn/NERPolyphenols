  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a major public health challenge, with approximately 32.4% of adults globally diagnosed with the condition and a steadily increasing prevalence. Currently, no specific medicines are approved to manage MASLD effectively. Silymarin, a common herbal agent with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties, presents potential therapeutic benefits for MASLD in both its monotherapy and complex forms (complexation with solubilising agents, such as vitamin E, phosphatidyl choline, etc.).",
