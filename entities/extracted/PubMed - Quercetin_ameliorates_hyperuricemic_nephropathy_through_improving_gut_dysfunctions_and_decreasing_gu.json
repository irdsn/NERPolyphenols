  "abstract": "Hyperuricemia (HUA) is closely associated with gut dysbiosis, yet the role of microbial metabolism in hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) remains poorly understood. Quercetin has shown urate-lowering and nephroprotective effects, but its therapeutic mechanisms, particularly in modulating the gut microbiome and microbial metabolism, remain elusive.",
