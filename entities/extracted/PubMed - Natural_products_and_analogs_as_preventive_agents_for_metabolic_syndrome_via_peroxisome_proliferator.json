  "abstract": "Natural products and synthetic analogs have drawn much attention as potential therapeutical drugs to treat metabolic syndrome. We reviewed the underlying mechanisms of 32 natural products and analogs with potential pharmacological effects in\u00a0vitro, and especially in rodent models and/or patients, that usually act on the PPAR pathway, along with other molecular targets. Recent outstanding total syntheses or semisyntheses of these lead compounds are stated. In general, they can activate the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4, PPAR\u03b3/\u03b4 and panPPAR as weak, partial agonists or selective PPAR\u03b3 modulators (SPPAR\u03b3M), which may be useful for managing obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia and non-fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Terpenoids is the largest group of compounds that act as potential modulators on PPARs and are comprised from small lipophilic cannabinoids to lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes and polar saponins. Shikimates-phenylpropanoids include polar heterocyclic flavonoids and phenolic compounds containing at least one C3-C6 unit and usually a double bond on the propyl chain. Quercetin (19), resveratrol (24) and curcumin (27), stand out from this group for exhibiting beneficial effects on patients. Alkaloids, the minor group of potential modulators on PPARs, include berberine (30), which has been widely explored in preclinical and clinical studies for its potential beneficial effects on T2D and dyslipidemia. However, large-scale clinical trials may be warranted for the promising compounds.",
