  "abstract": "Seaweed phenolics are increasingly recognized for their importance as functional foods, food additives, and sources of antioxidants, with applications that include supporting the prevention and treatment of lifestyle conditions and age-related diseases. However, one of the bottlenecks for seaweed applications is phenolic extraction, and sustainable extraction faces challenges due to environmentally toxic conventional methods. Newer advanced extraction techniques such as ultrasound-, microwave-, enzyme-, accelerated solvent-, and supercritical CO\u2082-assisted extraction has been evaluated to enhance yield, selectivity, and sustainability. Replacing conventional solvents with Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) offers in addition a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach. This review provides a brief background on seaweed phenolics, examines extraction challenges, discusses advanced technologies, and explores potential emerging methods that integrate advanced technologies with NADES. It also compares NADES with traditional methods and considers the potential of NADES-extracted seaweed phenolics, offering insights into emerging trends to refine extraction methodologies within a sustainable bioeconomy.",
