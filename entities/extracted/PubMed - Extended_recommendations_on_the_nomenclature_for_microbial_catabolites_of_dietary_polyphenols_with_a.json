  "abstract": "There is an increasing body of evidence indicating that phenolic compounds derived from microbiota-mediated breakdown of dietary (poly)phenolics in the colon are at least partially responsible for the beneficial effects of a plant-based diet. Investigating the role of these catabolites and defining their particular biological effects is challenging due to the complex microbial pathways and the diversity of structures that are produced. When reviewing the data this is further exacerbated by the inconsistency and lack of standardization in naming the microbial phenolics. Here we update the nomenclature of colonic catabolites of dietary (poly)phenols, extending the proposals of Kayet al.(Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 2020,112, 1051-1068, DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/nqaa204), by providing additional structures, and addressing the difficulties that can arise when investigating regioisomers and stereoisomers, where subtle differences in structure can have a substantial impact on bioactivity. The information provided will help to better harmonize the literature, facilitate data retrieval and provide a reference for researchers in several fields, especially nutrition and biochemistry.",
