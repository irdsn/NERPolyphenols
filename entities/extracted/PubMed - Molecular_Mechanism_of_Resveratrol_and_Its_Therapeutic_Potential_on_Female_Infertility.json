  "abstract": "Resveratrol is a polyphenol present in various plant sources. Studies have reported numerous potential health benefits of resveratrol, exhibiting anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-carcinogenic activity. Due to the reported effects, resveratrol is also being tested in reproductive disorders, including female infertility. Numerous cellular, animal, and even human studies were performed with a focus on the effect of resveratrol on female infertility. In this review, we reviewed some of its molecular mechanisms of action and summarized animal and human studies regarding resveratrol and female infertility, with a focus on age-related infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome, and endometriosis.",
