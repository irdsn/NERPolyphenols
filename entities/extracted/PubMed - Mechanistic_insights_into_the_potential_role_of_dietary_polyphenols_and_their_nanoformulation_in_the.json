  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very common neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory loss and a progressive decline in cognitive activity. The two major pathophysiological factors responsible for AD are amyloid plaques (comprising amyloid-beta aggregates) and neurofibrillary tangles (consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein). Polyphenols, a class of naturally occurring compounds, are immensely beneficial for the treatment or management of various disorders and illnesses. Naturally occurring sources of polyphenols include plants and plant-based foods, such as fruits, herbs, tea, vegetables, coffee, red wine, and dark chocolate. Polyphenols have unique properties, such as being the major source of anti-oxidants and possessing anti-aging and anti-cancerous properties. Currently, dietary polyphenols have become a potential therapeutic approach for the management of AD, depending on various research findings. Dietary polyphenols can be an effective strategy to tackle multifactorial events that occur with AD. For instance, naturally occurring polyphenols have been reported to exhibit neuroprotection by modulating the A\u03b2 biogenesis pathway in AD. Many nanoformulations have been established to enhance the bioavailability of polyphenols, with nanonization being the most promising. This review comprehensively provides mechanistic insights into the neuroprotective potential of dietary polyphenols in treating AD. It also reviews the usability of dietary polyphenol as nanoformulation for AD treatment.",
