  "abstract": "Camellia oleifera shells (COS) are a by-product of camellia oil processing and are rich in polyphenols. To date, the polyphenols extracted from COS have not been fully developed. In this study, two polyphenol fractions, referred to as 20P and 40P, were obtained by sequentially eluting the COS crude extract from an AB-8 macroporous resin column using ethanol at concentrations of 20% and 40% with different polarities. In addition, the biotransformation processes of these two polyphenols and their effects on the gut microbiota were studied.",
