  "abstract": "Activated neutrophils can create structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs/ETs) consisting of nuclear components and granules. The ETOsis phenomenon leads to activating the platelets and coagulation factors. Accordingly, coagulation and fibrinolysis can be promoted. Resveratrol (RSV) is a botanical antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and anti-leukemia effects. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of RSV on the occurrence of ETOsis in the NB4 cell line.",
