  "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common gynecological condition primarily caused byCandida albicans. The excessive use of antifungal drugs has led to increased drug resistance, necessitating the search for alternative therapies. This study investigates the synergistic antifungal effects of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) and probiotics againstC. albicans. PACs were prepared at different concentrations (low, medium, high) and tested alone and in combination with multi-strain probiotics, includingLactobacillus rhamnosusandLactobacillus plantarum. The antifungal activity of their cell-free supernatants (CFS) was also assessed. The results demonstrated that the combination ofL. plantarumand medium-concentration PACs (L.p. + PACs M) significantly enhathe inhibitionition ofC. albicanscompared to individual treatments. In the Vaginal Microbiota Communities Analysis, this condition reducedC. albicansrelative abundance to below 0.01%. This study highlights the potential of natural compounds and probiotics as alternative therapeutic strategies for VVC.",
