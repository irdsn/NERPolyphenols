  "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive cancer with a high mortality rate. San-Zhong-Kui-Jian-Tang (SZKJT), a Chinese herbal formula, has long been used as an adjuvant therapy in cancer clinical practice. Although its therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms in OSCC have been previously elucidated, the potential interactions and mechanisms between the active phytochemicals and their therapeutic targets are still lacking.",
