  "abstract": "Urtica dioicais widely distributed across temperate regions of the world and is highly beneficial and packed with nutritional value including a rich profile of phytochemicals, amino acids, and essential minerals. Due to abundance of these attributes, the nutritional, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties ofUrtica dioicawere assessed systematically. Additionally, proximate, functional, antinutrient, mineral, polyphenolic compounds, FRAP, and DPPH assays were also examined. The findings revealed thatUrtica dioicacontains high Mg, Ca, Fe, and Zn. The examined values of DPPH and FRAP showed high antioxidant potential ofUrtica dioica.UHPLC and GC-MS analysis confirmedUrtica dioicaas an excellent source of phenolic and bioactive compounds. In view of these experimental findings,Urtica dioicacan be incorporated into edible coatings and functional foods. Its excellent antimicrobial properties against Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacteria underscore its viability as an excellent source of functional ingredients in edible coatings.",
