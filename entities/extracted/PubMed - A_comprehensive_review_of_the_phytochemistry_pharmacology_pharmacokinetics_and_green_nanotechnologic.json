  "abstract": "A comprehensive study of Boerhavia diffusa Linn., an important medicinal herb in India's Ayurvedic tradition known as Punarnava. The herb, which thrives in tropical and subtropical areas, has long been prized for its amazing medicinal powers. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Springer, and Elsevier with the search term \"Boerhavia diffusa\" phytochemical makeup comprises alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, phenolics, and saponins, all of which contribute to its various pharmacological properties. These chemicals have a variety of biological actions, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, and antibacterial effects. Boerhavia diffusa has long been used to treat illnesses such as liver disease, arthritis, asthma, and kidney problems. The paper goes into the pharmacokinetic problems of Boerhavia diffusa's bioactive chemicals, including their low bioavailability. It demonstrates the growing interest in using green nanotechnology to improve the transport and efficacy of these substances. Environmentally friendly nanocarriers are being created to transport Boerhavia diffusa chemicals more efficiently, especially in cancer therapies, wound healing, and antibacterial treatments. These nanocarriers improve targeted medication delivery, reduce toxicity, and increase bioavailability, resulting in a sustainable and friendly solution. Combining green nanotechnology with Boerhavia diffusa opens up new possibilities for modern medical applications, providing a more efficient, safe, and environmentally responsible solution. This review emphasizes Boerhavia diffusa's enormous potential as both a traditional medicine and a component of modern therapeutic breakthroughs, integrating millennia of Indigenous knowledge with cutting-edge scientific advances.",
