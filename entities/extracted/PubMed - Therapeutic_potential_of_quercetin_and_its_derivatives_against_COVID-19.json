  "abstract": "Quercetin is a natural flavonoid with a wide range of biological activity. This compound does not penetrate the brain well, but under stress, it exhibits neuroprotective properties, probably associated with its effect on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB disruption may be responsible for the invasion of the causative agent of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) into the brain with the development of neurological symptoms. Quercetin can suppress viral replication, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response, as well as prevent the formation of microthrombi. This potential of quercetin may help treat COVID-19 and its long-term sequelae.",
