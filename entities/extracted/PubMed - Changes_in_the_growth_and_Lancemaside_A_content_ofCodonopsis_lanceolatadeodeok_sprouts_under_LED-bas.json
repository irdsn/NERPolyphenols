  "abstract": "Codonopsis lanceolata(deodeok) is used in traditional medicine because it contains saponins with high medicinal value. While previous studies have explored the general effects of red/far-red (R/FR) ratios on plant morphology and secondary metabolites, the specific impact of FR light on plant growth and bioactive compound accumulation ofC. lanceolatasprouts remains largely unexplored.",
