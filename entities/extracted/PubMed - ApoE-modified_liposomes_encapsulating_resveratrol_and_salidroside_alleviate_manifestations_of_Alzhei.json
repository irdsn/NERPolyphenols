  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is associated with aging and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Several studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that resveratrol (Res) and salidroside (Sal) are not only biologically safe but also influence AD biomarker trajectories. However, their clinical applications have been quite limited due to poor specificity, low solubility, and insufficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Therefore, we developed a nano-drug delivery system in which Res and Sal were encapsulated in liposomes, which were surface-modified with ApoE (ApoE-Res/Sal-Lips) to compensate for these deficiencies.",
