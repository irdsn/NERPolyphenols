  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-established neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral disturbances. With the global population aging, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, presenting significant challenges to both society and healthcare systems. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric rhizomes, has demonstrated considerable potential in AD treatment due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. However, its clinical application remains constrained by chemical instability, poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and accelerated elimination. To overcome these limitations, various curcumin derivatives have been synthesized, and combination therapy strategies have been explored. This review examines the potential mechanisms through which curcumin may exert therapeutic effects in AD, including the inhibition of neuroinflammation, regulation of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides, and provision of antioxidant benefits. Additionally, the advantages of curcumin derivatives and combination therapy approaches are discussed, offering novel perspectives and promising strategies for AD treatment. It is anticipated that advancements in drug design and therapeutic approaches will contribute to the development of more effective treatment options for AD.",
