  "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common, life threatening inherited kidney diseases. In the kidney, senescence is accumulated in different renal cells, which are in a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in response to stresses. However, the role of cellular senescence in ADPKD remains elusive.",
