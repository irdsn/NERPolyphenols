  "abstract": "Red flesh is a desired fruit trait, but the regulation of red flesh formation in grape is not well understood. 'Mio Red' is a seedless table grape variety with light-red flesh and blue-purple skin. The skin color develops at veraison whereas the flesh color develops at a later stage of berry development. The flesh and skin flavonoid metabolomes and transcriptomes were analyzed.",
