  "title": "Genotoxic and Oxidative Damage of Environmental Pollutant Microplastics on Zebrafish (Danio rerio).",
  "abstract": "Microplastics are any synthetic solid particles or polymeric matrices ranging in size from 1 to 5\u2009mm and insoluble in water. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) microplastics on DNA damage (8-OHdG), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP \u03bcM/mg protein), malondialdehyde (MDA nmol/g tissue), and glutathione (GSH \u03bcmol/g tissue) in zebrafish. Zebrafish with an average length of 3-5\u2009cm were placed in aquariums filled with spring water with 1-5-\u03bcm PE and 9.5-11.5-\u03bcm PS at 1- and 10-mg/L concentrations for 96\u2009h and 21\u2009days. The tissue levels of MDA exposed to 1-mg/L PS and PE (p\u2009=\u20090.008, p\u2009=\u20090.041) and GSH exposed to 1- and 10-mg/L PE (p\u2009=\u20090.004, p\u2009=\u20090.004) in 96\u2009h were increased compared to the control group. GSH (1 and 10-mg/L PS in 21\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.033, p\u2009=\u20090.045) and AOPP levels (1- and 10-mg/L PS in 96\u2009h, p\u2009=\u20090.008, p\u2009<\u20090001) were decreased compared to the control group. DNA damage at 8-OHdG levels (96\u2009h, 10-mg/L PS, p\u2009=\u20090.030) was decreased compared to the control and increased in the 1-mg/L PE at 21\u2009days (p\u2009=\u20090.028). The 1- and 10-mg/L PE and PS microplastic doses were thought to affect the oxidant-antioxidant system. Besides, they may damage DNA in zebrafish, depending on the dosage and exposure time of the chemicals.",
