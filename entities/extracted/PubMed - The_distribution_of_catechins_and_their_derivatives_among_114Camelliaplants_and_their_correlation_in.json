  "abstract": "China is rich in tea germplasm resources. Catechins and their derivatives were analyzed regarding their associations among species and tea-processing suitability using 114 representativeCamelliaplants. GCG, ECG, EGC, ECG3\u2033Me, and EGCG were revealed as potentially useful markers for identifying different tea species, while threeO-methylated catechins may be appropriate markers for determining the tea-processing suitability of oolong tea. A correlation analysis indicated that the EGCG3\u2033Me content was significantly higher in varieties suitable for oolong tea than in varieties suitable for black and green teas. Catechin (C, GC, CG, and GCG) contents were significantly higher inCamellia ptilophyllaChang than inCamellia sinensisvar.sinensis,Camellia sinensisvar.assamica, andCamellia sinensisvar.pubilimbaChang. Furthermore, 14 specific tea tree resources with a high catechin index and high EGCG, GCG, and EGCG3\u2033Me contents were screened. This research enhances our understanding of associations among catechins and tea germplasm resources.",
