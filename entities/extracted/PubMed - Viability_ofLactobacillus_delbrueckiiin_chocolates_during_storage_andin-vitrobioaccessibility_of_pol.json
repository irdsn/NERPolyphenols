  "abstract": "This study evaluated the viability of encapsulatedLactobacillus delbrueckiisubsp.bulgaricusin chocolate during storage andin-vitrogastrointestinal transit. Flavonoid contents and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production during gastrointestinal transit were also assessed. Encapsulated L.delbrueckiisubsp.bulgaricussurvived well in chocolates >7 logs both after 120 days of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and duringin-vitrogastrointestinal transit. The release of SCFAs throughin-vitrogastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation revealed that probiotic-chocolates could be an excellent source of nutrients for the gut microbiota. Encapsulated probiotic in chocolates with 70% cocoa produced significantly (P<\u00a00.05) more acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric and isovaleric acids than that with 45% cocoa. The bioconversion results of a specific polyphenol byL. delbrueckiisubsp.bulgaricusexhibited that chocolate polyphenols could be utilized by probiotics for their metabolism. These findings confirmed that chocolate could be successfully fortified withL. delbrueckiisubsp.bulgaricusencapsulation to improve health promoting properties of chocolates.",
