  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance and long-term complications. Dietary antioxidants from plant sources, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolic acids, have been increasingly studied for their potential to modulate these pathophysiological mechanisms.",
