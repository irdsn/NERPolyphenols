  "title": "Oligomeric proanthocyanidin attenuates asthma severity and airway remodeling by modulating epithelial-smooth muscle cell interactions.",
  "abstract": "As a significant instigator of asthma pathogenesis, the airway epithelium produces cytokines that disrupt lung homeostasis and contribute to airway remodeling. Although efforts are directed in the management of this progress but few have proved effective. Recently, there is a cue that oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC), a widely used antioxidant supplement extracted from grape seeds with a broad safety margin, presents potential in asthmatic mice while the mechanism remains unclear.",
