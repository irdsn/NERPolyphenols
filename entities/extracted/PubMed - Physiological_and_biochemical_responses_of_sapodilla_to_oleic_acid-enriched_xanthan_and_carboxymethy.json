  "abstract": "Sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) is a tropical climacteric fruit with a notably short postharvest life due to rapid softening and water loss. This study investigated the efficacy of three edible coating formulations-Xanthan gum (Xan) 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0oleic acid (OA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) 1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA, and CMC 1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0Xan 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA in preserving sapodilla fruits stored at 8\u00a0\u00b0C and 85-90\u00a0% relative humidity over 40\u00a0days. Results showed that all coated fruits significantly outperformed the control in terms of postharvest quality. The CMC 1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0Xan 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA treatment recorded the lowest weight loss (10.8\u00a0%) and the highest firmness (78.32\u00a0N) by day 40. The lowest respiration rate (19\u00a0mg CO\u2082/kg.h) observed in fruit treated with Xan 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA, significantly lower than the control (62.3\u00a0mg CO\u2082/kg/h). Fruits coated with CMC 1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0Xan 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA exhibited the lowest chilling injury (0.64), malondialdehyde (MDA) content (0.48\u00a0nmol\u00a0g-1FW) and electrolyte leakage (78\u00a0%), indicating better membrane integrity. Additionally, this formulation maintained higher levels of ascorbic acid (106\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g FW), total phenolics (35.6\u00a0mg GAE/100\u00a0g FW), and flavonoids (6.84\u00a0mg QE/100\u00a0g FW). This treatment significantly elevated antioxidant enzyme activities, with catalase reaching 4.42\u00a0U/g FW, peroxidase 0.8\u00a0U/g FW, and superoxide dismutase 3.4\u00a0U/g FW, while notably reducing polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity to 23.5\u00a0U/g FW. Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly differentiated the CMC 1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0Xan 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA treatment from other treatments and the control, confirming its superior efficacy. In conclusion, the CMC 1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0Xan 0.1\u00a0%\u00a0+\u00a0OA significantly extends the shelf life and preserves the physicochemical and nutritional quality of sapodilla, making it a promising and sustainable postharvest strategy.",
