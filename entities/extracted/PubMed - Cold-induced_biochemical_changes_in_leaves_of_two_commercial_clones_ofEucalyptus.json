  "abstract": "Cold weather poses a significant challenge to the growth of crops and subtropical tree species likeEucalyptus. Exposure of plants to stressful temperatures generates changes in their physiology resulting from modifications in gene expression and extensive metabolic reorganization. A direct comparison of several biochemical changes under cold exposure of leaf tissues ofE. dunniiandE. grandisclones was carried out.",
