  "abstract": "Wen Dan Decoction (WDD) is primarily utilized as an \"expectorant\" in clinical practice. The combination of WDD and Lian Qiao (LQWDD) exhibits synergistic effects on phlegm resolution, qi regulation, and detoxification. In preliminary clinical practice, we observed that LQWDD effectively alleviates the severity of gastric precancerous lesions. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.",
