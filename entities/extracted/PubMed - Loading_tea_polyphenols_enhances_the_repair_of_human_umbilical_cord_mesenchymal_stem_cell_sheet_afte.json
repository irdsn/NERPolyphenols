  "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating central nervous system disorder that remains a global health challenge. SCI-induced oxidative stress in the postinjury microenvironment limits tissue repair by provoking the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tea polyphenols (TP), as a natural plant polyphenol, could effectively reduce ROS. In recent years, stem cell-based therapy combined with cell sheet technology has been widely used in the treatment of SCI. Therefore, we constructed human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell sheet loaded with TP (CS-TP) and evaluated their therapeutic effects and mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo in SCI rats.",
