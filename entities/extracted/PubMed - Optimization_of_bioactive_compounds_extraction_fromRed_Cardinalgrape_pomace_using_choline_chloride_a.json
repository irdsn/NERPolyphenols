  "abstract": "Grape pomace, a major by-product of the wine and juice industries, presents considerable potential for extracting valuable bioactive compounds. This study aimed to optimize the extraction process using deep eutectic solvents composed of choline chloride and lactic acid. The extraction focused on three key factors: solvent-to-material ratio, extraction temperature, and extraction time, employing response surface methodology with a central composite design. The results showed that the optimal extraction conditions were achieved at a solvent-to-material ratio of 25:1 (v\u2009\u00b7\u2009w-1), an extraction temperature of 70\u2009\u00b0C, and an extraction time of 118\u2009min. Under these conditions, the extract exhibited high levels of total phenolic content (81.90\u2009\u00b1\u20091.06\u2009mg GAE\u2009\u00b7\u2009g-1DW), total saponin content (174.66\u2009\u00b1\u20092.87\u2009mg AE\u2009\u00b7\u2009g-1DW), and total proanthocyanidin content (31.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50\u2009mg CE\u2009\u00b7\u2009g-1DW). Furthermore, the extract demonstrated strong antioxidant capacity and antibacterial activities against four microbial strains (Escherichia coliATCC 8739,Salmonella typhimuriumATCC 14028,Bacillus subtilisATCC 6633,Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538). These findings underscore the extract's potential for diverse industrial applications, including the food, nutraceutical, and cosmetic sectors.",
