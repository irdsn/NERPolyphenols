  "abstract": "Phenylnaphthalene-type lignans have been recognized as the major anti-inflammatory constituents in V. negundo seeds, among which vitedoamine A (VA) was the first discovered lignan alkaloid bearing a \u03b3-lactam. However, the protective effects and specific target of VA against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have not been explored yet. Herein, our study revealed that VA could inhibit the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB, and suppress the production of NO and reduce the expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) in several inflammatory cell models, mainly via inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and p65, and prevented the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, thus restraining NF-\u03baB activation. Meanwhile, VA considerably down-regulated the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and p65, and inhibited the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in RANKL-induced osteoclasts formation and differentiation, suggesting that VA may impede osteoclastogenesis and relieve joint damage in RA. Furthermore, VA interfered IKK/I\u03baB\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway and decreased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines in IL-1\u03b2 stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), suggesting that VA possessed promising in vitro anti-RA capacity, probably by direct targeting IKK\u03b2 and inhibiting its activity (IC50value: 39\u00a0\u03bcM). In addition, molecular docking displayed that VA could bind with residues Cys99 and Asp103 in IKK\u03b2 via hydrogen bonds, thus preventing ATP from binding with IKK\u03b2 to inhibit the activity of IKK\u03b2. Taken together, VA directly targets IKK\u03b2 and significantly inhibits the IKK/I\u03baB\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway, thus inhibiting inflammatory responses in FLSs and mitigating joint damage related to osteoclastogenesis, displaying great potential in treating RA.",
