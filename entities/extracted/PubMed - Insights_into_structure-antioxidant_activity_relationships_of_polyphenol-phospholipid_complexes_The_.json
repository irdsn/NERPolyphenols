  "title": "Insights into structure-antioxidant activity relationships of polyphenol-phospholipid complexes: The effect of hydrogen bonds formed by phenolic hydroxyl groups.",
  "abstract": "Five typical polyphenols (catechin, quercetin, gallic acid, ellagic acid, and chlorogenic acid) were selected to form non-covalent complexes with soy lecithin, confirmed by1H NMR, X-ray, DSC, and molecular docking simulations. Subsequently, the impacts of complexation on the antioxidant activity were evaluated using five different methods to analyze structure-activity relationships. The results showed that the complexation with phospholipids would not reduce the antioxidant activity of polyphenols, mainly attributed to three mechanisms: (i) the amphiphilic nature of phospholipids enhanced polyphenol solubility via encapsulation and amorphous state stabilization, (ii) hydrogen-bond networks immobilized reactive hydroxyl groups while shielding them from oxidative environments, and (iii) phospholipid-mediated kinetic solvent effects reduced the bond dissociation energy and optimized sustained antioxidant release kinetics. This study provides deeper insights into the interaction mechanisms between polyphenols and phospholipids and supports wider potential applications of polyphenols.",
