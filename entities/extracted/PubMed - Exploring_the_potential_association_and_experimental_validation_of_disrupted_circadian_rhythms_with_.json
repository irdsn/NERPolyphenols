  "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been extensively studied as a common female endocrine disease. In recent years, the relationship between circadian rhythm and PCOS has gradually drawn attention, although the precise nature of this connection remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore further links between circadian rhythm and PCOS and to identify potential mediators of the pathogenesis of PCOS.",
