  "abstract": "Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is an economically significant plant because of its components that benefit human health and emotion. This review was conducted to provide updated insights into cocoa chemical concentrations, profiles, and influencing factors. Cocoa products and by-products contain various beneficial substances like minerals, lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, polyphenols, methylxanthines, bioactive amines, and aromas. However, these materials have been contaminated with heavy metals, organic pollutants, and mycotoxins due to improper cultivation and processing. For the first time, concentrations and profiles of toxic elements and organic contaminants in cocoa samples were reviewed. Plant varieties, geographical origins, and production methods influence cocoa chemical contents and profiles. Improvements in cocoa production technologies are essential to maximize economic and health benefits and reduce toxic substances in cocoa products. Additional investigations should be performed to understand the chemistry of cocoa and fill research gaps regarding the chemical profiles of this plant species.",
