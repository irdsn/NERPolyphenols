  "title": "Development of fluorescence sensor based on molecularly imprinted carbon quantum dots for sensitive and selective detection of rutin.",
  "abstract": "A\u00a0sensitive and selective fluorescence sensor for rutin was successfully developed. The sensor was fabricated from highly fluorescent nitrogen-boron co-doped carbon quantum dots (N,B-CDs) coated with mesoporous silica molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). Rutin was detected by this sensor (N,B-CDs @ MIP) with a linear range of 0.08-30\u00a0\u03bcM and a detection limit as low as 0.05\u00a0\u03bcM, under optimal conditions. Meanwhile, the usefulness of the developed sensor was evaluated in samples of lake water, orange, and honey with satisfactory recoveries.",
