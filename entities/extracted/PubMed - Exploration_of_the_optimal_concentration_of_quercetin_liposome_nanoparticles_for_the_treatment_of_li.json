  "abstract": "Hepatic injury is a common pathological process for a wide spectrum of liver diseases. Quercetin has been found to counteract this process by scavenging free radicals, but its therapeutic effect is limited due to poor water-solubility. Thus, the question of how to deliver quercetin to a target organ effectively with minimal side effects has remained a clinical challenge. Our previous research findings indicate that when quercetin is delivered in the form of liposomal nanoparticles, its targeting efficiency to the liver is significantly enhanced. Although quercetin liposomal nanoparticles have been shown to improve the therapeutic effect on liver damage compared to traditional quercetin treatment, the optimal dosage of liposomal quercetin still warrants further exploration. The aim of this study was therefore to ascertain whether there are differences in the therapeutic effects on liver damage at different dosages of quercetin liposomes and to determine the optimal dosage.",
