  "abstract": "Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix (CCAC) or vagina (CCAV) is rare and usually presents in postmenopausal women. Paediatric cases are rare, and have historically been associated with intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES). We aimed to summarise outcomes of CCAC and CCAV in children with no history of DES exposure.",
