  "abstract": "In this study, a two-step modification was used to improve the stability of grape skin anthocyanins (GSA). First, GSA was chemically modified with Mandelic acid (MA) to obtain modified grape skin anthocyanin (MGSA), and then MGSA was physically mixed with betalains (BL) and shikonin (SKN) to obtain mixed pigment (MP). UV spectral analysis showed the successful chemical modification of GSA. The chemical modification significantly improved the stability of anthocyanins, especially in alkaline environment (pH\u00a0=\u00a012) by 45.09\u00a0%. The co-modified pigments showed significant pH sensitivity in different buffers and the best stabilization was obtained when MGSA: BL: SKN was 1:1:3 (MP113), with 43.95\u00a0% and 79.42\u00a0% increase in oxidative stability compared to GSA and MGSA, respectively. Anthocyanins were added to gelling gel (GG) to prepare pH-responsive smart packaging films. The results showed that the films using mixed pigments as indicators exhibited improved optical properties, mechanical properties, water resistance and oxidation resistance compared to GG films. In the freshness monitoring of chicken breast meat, the film using MP113 as an indicator can not only determine the freshness of chicken breast meat by color, but also extend the shelf life of chicken breast meat by >1\u00a0day.",
