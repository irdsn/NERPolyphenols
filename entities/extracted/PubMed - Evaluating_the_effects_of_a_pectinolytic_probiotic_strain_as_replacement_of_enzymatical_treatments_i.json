  "abstract": "The objective of the current study was to investigate and compare the impact of enzymatic hydrolysis and pre-fermentation with probiotics on the biological activity and metabolic profile of melon juice. We found that fermentation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum N13, not only decreased the juice pH, total soluble solids and reducing sugar, but also promoted the release of phenolic compounds, increased antioxidant activity and improved juice's aroma profile. Although pectinase and cellulase aided in the release of reducing sugar and total phenols in the juice, the heating process involved in the enzymatic treatment decreased total soluble solids and phenolics in the juice. Altogether, both enzymatic treatment and fermentation with probiotics could aid in the release of bioactive compounds, while fermentation with probiotics demonstrated greater impact on the biological activity and metabolic profile of melon juice. The findings of the current study suggested the use of probiotic cultivars in the pre-alcohol-fermentation process.",
