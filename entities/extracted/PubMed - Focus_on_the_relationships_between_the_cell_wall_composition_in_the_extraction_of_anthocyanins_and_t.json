  "abstract": "Concentrations of anthocyanins and tannins after extraction from berries in wines and from skin macerations in model solutions have been studied for two grape varieties, two maturation levels and two vintages berries. Characterization of the cell wall polysaccharides has also been performed, the classical method based on the analysis of the neutral sugars after depolymerization being completed by a comprehensive microarray polymer profiling (CoMPP). Extraction was lower in model solutions than in wines, with the same ranking: non acylated anthocyanins> tannins > p-coumaroylated anthocyanins. The polysaccharidic composition suggested a role of homogalacturonans, rhamnogalacturonans and extensins in the extraction process. A global explanation of the interactions between anthocyanins, tannins and polysaccharides is proposed.",
