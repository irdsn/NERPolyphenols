  "title": "Effects of Resveratrol on Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC): A Comprehensive Review.",
  "abstract": "Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) represents the most prevalent form of skin cancer globally, with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) being the most common types. The search for effective chemopreventive and therapeutic agents has led to the exploration of natural compounds, among which resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in grapes, berries, peanuts, and red wine, has garnered significant attention. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the effects of RES on NMSC, focusing on its mechanisms of action, efficacy in preclinical studies, and potential as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. RES exhibits promising chemopreventive and antineoplastic capabilities against NMSC through various mechanisms, including the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, modulation of oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory activities. Studies have demonstrated that RES can significantly enhance the effectiveness of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), by inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis in cancerous cells. Furthermore, resveratrol's antioxidant properties may mitigate the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by UV exposure, thus reducing DNA damage and mutations associated with skin cancer development. In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments have shown that RES can effectively hinder the growth and spread of various tumor cell types, including human cutaneous SCC A431 cells, and induce apoptosis. The development of advanced delivery systems, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and liposomes, has been recognized for their potential to enhance the therapeutic effects of RES, particularly its anticancer properties. In conclusion, RES presents a viable candidate for the prevention and treatment of NMSC, owing to its multifaceted mechanisms of action, including its ability to regulate oxidative stress, trigger apoptosis, and inhibit proliferation. However, further clinical studies are required to fully understand its effectiveness and safety in humans, as well as to optimize delivery methods for improved bioavailability and therapeutic outcomes.",
