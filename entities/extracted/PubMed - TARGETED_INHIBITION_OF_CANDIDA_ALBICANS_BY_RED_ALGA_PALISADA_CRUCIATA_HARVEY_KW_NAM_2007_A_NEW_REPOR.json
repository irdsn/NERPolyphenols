  "abstract": "The biotechnological potential of marine red seaweed remains an active area of research against microbial infections caused by fungal pathogens. In this study, the methanolic extract of Palisada cruciata. was evaluated for its efficacy in anti-candidal and antioxidant activities, highlighting its potential as a source of bioactive compounds from an unexplored species of P. cruciata, which adds valuable information against Candida infections. The extract demonstrated significant antifungal activity against Candida albicans strains C11 and C13, with inhibition zones of 11 mm and 10 mm at 1 mg/mL, respectively, outperforming extracts from Sargassum wightii and Caulerpa scalpelliformis. Antioxidant assays further confirmed its bioactivity, with 66.88 \u00b1 1.8% DPPH radical scavenging, 62.5 \u00b1 2.0% hydroxyl radical scavenging, and a total antioxidant capacity of 68.83 \u00b1 2.8 \u03bcg AAE/g. Phytochemical screening confirms the presence of secondary metabolites such as terpenoids, phenols, and sterols, which are known contributors to antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. FT-IR analysis revealed key functional groups, including alkanes, amines, and aromatic compounds, while GC-MS detected major constituents such as n-Hexadecenoic acid (62.16%), 2-Pentadecanone (10.94%), and Hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (8.72%), alongside bioactive hydrocarbons and long-chain alcohols. Thin-layer chromatography further demonstrated the extract's chemical complexity and diversity. Given the rising concern over antifungal resistance, P. cruciata. presents a promising candidate for the development of novel anti-candidal agents. This study underscores the significance of marine-derived bioactive in pharmaceutical applications, advocating for further isolation, structural characterization, and mechanistic studies. Expanding research into marine natural products can contribute to sustainable drug discovery, addressing the growing need for alternative antifungal therapies.",
