  "title": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: a new frontier in male reproductive system.",
  "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor historically recognized for its role in the regulation of toxicity mediated by environmental chemicals. Recent research points to AhR's critical participation in male reproductive physiology, particularly in spermatogenesis, hormone signaling, and the maintenance of sperm quality. Both endogenous ligands (e.g., dietary and gut microbiota-derived metabolites) and exogenous pollutants (e.g., dioxins and benzo-\u03b1-pyrene) influence AhR-mediated pathways, making it a key link between environmental exposures and male fertility.",
