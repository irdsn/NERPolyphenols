  "abstract": "Sirt1 is crucial for cartilage homeostasis, and its dysregulation is implicated in Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), an osteochondropathy linked to HT-2 toxin exposure. This study investigated Sirt1's role in HT-2 toxin-induced chondrocyte injury. Human fetal chondrocytes treated with HT-2 toxin (0, 5, 10, 20ng/mL) for 48 hours showed dose-dependent viability reduction, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation (\u2193Collagen II, \u2193TIMP1, \u2191MMP13), and senescence (\u2191P21, \u2191\u03b2-galactosidase). HT-2 toxin suppressed Sirt1 while activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (\u2191WNT3A, \u2191\u03b2-catenin). Resveratrol (25\u03bcM), a Sirt1 agonist, restored TIMP1 and Collagen II levels and reduced P21 without affecting MMP13, while inhibiting the WNT3A/\u03b2-catenin pathway. These results demonstrate that Sirt1 activation mitigates HT-2 toxin-induced chondrocyte damage by inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.",
