  "abstract": "Purple tea variety ofCamelia sinensis(L.) Kuntze (Theaceae), with its unique presence of anthocyanins and 1,2-di-O-galloyl-4,6-O-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose (GHG), has enormous potential in the weight management. Here, the weight loss mechanism of a standardized purple tea hydroalcoholic extract (PorelisTM, 3-5% GHG) is demonstrated in high-fat-diet-induced mice.",
