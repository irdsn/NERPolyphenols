  "abstract": "Ayurvedic texts mention the use ofAegle marmelosfruit in colitis and other gastrointestinal ailments. The polyphenolic contents of the fruit, however, have poor bioavailability, limiting their therapeutic use. The study aimed to develop and optimise theA. marmelosfruit extract-phospholipid (AMEP) complex to improve the oral bioavailability of theA. marmelosextract (AME), and compare thein vivoeffect of AME and AMEP in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in rats.",
