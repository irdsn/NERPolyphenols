  "abstract": "Isorhapontigenin (ISO) has been reported to exhibit various therapeutic effects including anti-inflammation and anti-cancer. However, it is still unclear whether ISO has therapeutic efficacy on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to determine the effects of ISO on regulating functions of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and further to explore the underlying mechanisms.",
