  "abstract": "Background:To compare the efficacy and safety of monthly administrations of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists LY01005 and Zoladex\u00aein Chinese patients with premenopausal breast cancer.Methods:From October 2020 to November 2021, 188 premenopausal breast cancer patients were enrolled in 34 hospitals and randomized 1:1 to receive either LY01005 or Zoladex\u00aeevery 28 days for a total of three injections. All patients concomitantly received oral tamoxifen (TAM). The primary efficacy endpoint was cumulative probability of maintaining menopausal level [oestradiol (E2) \u226430 pg/ml] from day 29 to day 85. The second efficacy endpoint included changes in E2, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) compared with the baseline. Pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety were analyzed. The study also evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of LY01005.Results:A total of 188 patients were randomised and 187 patients received either LY01005 or Zoladex\u00ae. Cumulative probabilities of maintaining menopausal level (E2\u226430 pg/ml) from day 29 to day 85 were 93.1% for LY01005 and 86.3% for Zoladex\u00ae. The between-group difference was 6.8% (95%CI: -2.3%, 15.9%) and primary efficacy in the LY01005 group was not inferior to that in the Zoladex\u00aegroup. Changes in E2, LH, and FSH levels compared with the baseline were equivalent between the two groups (E2: 89.34% to 90.23% vs. 82.11% to 85.02%; LH: 88.89% to 95.52% vs. 89.70% to 97.02%; FSH: 75.36% to 80.85% vs.73.07% to 80.24%, respectively). After three consecutive doses of LY01005, the LH and FSH levels of the subjects showed a transient increase after the first dose, reached a peak on the second day and then started to decrease. The LH and FSH reached a lower level and remained at or below that level until the 85th day. Both treatments were well-tolerated.Conclusion:LY01005 is as effective as Zoladex\u00aein suppressing E2 to menopausal levels in Chinese patients with premenopausal breast cancer, with a similar safety profile.",
