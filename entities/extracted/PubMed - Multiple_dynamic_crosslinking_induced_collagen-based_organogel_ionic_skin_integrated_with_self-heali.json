  "abstract": "Ionic skin based on conductive hydrogel has received considerable attention in sensing applications because of its flexibility and conductivity. Collagen, as a main component of the natural extracellular matrix, is an ideal candidate for constructing hydrogel-based bionic ionic skin. However, developing a collagen-based ionic skin integrated with multi-functions (e.g., self-healing, self-adhesion, anti-frozen, cytocompatibility, and antibacterial abilities) and multi-mode sensing capacities remains an important yet challenging task. In this work, inspired by the idea of leather tanning, a multifunctional organogel ionic skin was successfully constructed through multiple dynamic bonds (metal coordination, hydrophobic interaction, and hydrogen bonds) based on collagen, black wattle bark tannin, acrylic acid, and Zr4+. As a result of dynamic interactions and raw materials, the developed collagen-based organogel ionic skin has good mechanical properties, self-healing performance (healing efficiency of 83.2\u00a0%), and conductivity. Ingeniously introducing glycerol and silver nanoparticles enabled the ionic skin to exhibit good environmental suitability (anti-freezing and moisture retention) and antibacterial properties. The ionic skin also showed good adhesion (shear stress of 26.5\u00a0kPa to sheepskin) and cytocompatibility. Such multifunctional ionic skin can be assembled as a multi-modal sensor, which displays satisfactory sensitivity to strain, temperature, and bioelectricity with good signal stability and repeatability. This work not only provides a versatile approach for fabricating a multifunctional collagen-based organogel ionic skin for next-generation flexible devices but also promotes the high-value utilization of collagen.",
