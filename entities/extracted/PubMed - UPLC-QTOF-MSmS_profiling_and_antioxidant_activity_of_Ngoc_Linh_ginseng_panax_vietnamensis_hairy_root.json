  "abstract": "Panax vietnamensis(Ngoc Linh ginseng) hairy root extract (PV-HRE) was comprehensively analysedviaUPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. The analysis revealed 41 phytochemical constituents, predominantly saponins, with the major bioactive compounds identified as 23,27-dihydroxypennogenin, decumbesterone A, phytolaccagenin, trillin, and nigakilactone H. By employing a zebrafish model under hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, we demonstrated that PV-HRE pre-treatment significantly enhanced larval survival. Molecular investigations revealed Keap1/Nrf2 pathway-dependent mechanisms characterised by substantial upregulation of the antioxidant genes glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (gstp1) and peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1). Comparative experiments with Nrf2-deficient zebrafish (nfe2l2adl703)confirmed the critical role of the pathway in mediating protective cellular responses. These findings substantiate the therapeutic potential ofPanax vietnamensishairy root extract as a sophisticated natural intervention for oxidative stress-related pathological conditions.",
