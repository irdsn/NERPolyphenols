  "abstract": "This article reviews the synergistic effects of antioxidant-enriched functional foods and exercise in improving metabolic health, focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms. The review incorporates evidence from PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and reference lists of relevant reviews up to 20 December 2024, highlighting the central role of the Nrf2 pathway. As a critical regulator of oxidative stress and metabolic adaptation, Nrf2 mediates the benefits of these interventions. This article presents an innovative approach to understanding the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting its potential in the prevention and treatment of various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes, inflammatory conditions, ageing, and infections such as COVID-19. The novelty of this study is to investigate the synergistic effects of bioactive compounds found in functional foods (such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and vitamins) and exercise-induced oxidative stress on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. This combined approach reveals their potential to improve insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism and reduce inflammation, offering a promising strategy for the management of chronic diseases. However, there are significant gaps in current research, particularly regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between diet, physical activity, and Nrf2 activation, as well as their long-term effects in different populations, including those with chronic diseases. In addition, the interactions between Nrf2 and other critical signalling pathways, including AMPK, NF-\u03baB, and PI3K/Akt, and their collective contributions to metabolic health are explored. Furthermore, novel biomarkers are presented to assess the impact of these synergistic strategies, such as the NAD+/NADH ratio, the GSH ratio, and markers of mitochondrial health. The findings provide valuable insights into how the integration of an antioxidant-rich diet and regular exercise can improve metabolic health by activating Nrf2 and related molecular pathways and represent promising strategies for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders. Further studies are needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential of these interventions in diseases related to oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and cancer.",
