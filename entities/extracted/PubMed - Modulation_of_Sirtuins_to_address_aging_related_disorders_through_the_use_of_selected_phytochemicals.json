  "abstract": "Aging is a complex phenomenon involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular damage subsequently leading to various disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and cancer. Sirtuin (SIRT) proteins are one of the major molecular factors that affect human aging. Sirtuins are a class of NAD+-dependent enzymes that control oxidative stress response, DNA damage repair, inflammation and metabolism, all of which are involved in aging and age-related diseases.",
