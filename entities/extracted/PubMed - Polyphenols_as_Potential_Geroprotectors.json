  "abstract": "Significance:Currently, a large amount of evidence of beneficial effects of diets enriched with polyphenols on various aspects of health has been accumulated. These phytochemicals have a geroprotective potential slowing down the pathological processes associated with aging and ensuring longevity. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to determine the adherence of individual polyphenols to geroprotector criteria. Data from experimental models, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies were analyzed.Recent Advances:Sixty-two polyphenols have been described to increase the life span and improve biomarkers of aging in animal models. They actviaevolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms, including hormesis and maintenance of redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, response to cellular damage, metabolic control, and anti-inflammatory and senolytic activity. Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that certain polyphenols have a potential for prevention and treatment of various diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular conditions in humans.Critical Issues:Among the reviewed phytochemicals, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, epicatechin, genistein, resveratrol, and curcumin were identified as compounds with the highest geroprotective potential. However, there is a lack of unambiguous information on the effectiveness and safety of polyphenols for increasing health span, preventing and treating aging-associated diseases in humans.Future Directions:Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of polyphenols considering their long-term consumption, metabolic modification and bioavailability, complex interactions between different groups of polyphenols and with other phytochemicals, as well as their effects on individuals with different health status.Antioxid.
