  "abstract": "Resveratrol is a polyphenol and potent antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory effects in conditions such as atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory effects and protects against intracranial aneurysm formation and rupture in male mice. Intracranial aneurysms were induced in mice using a combination of elastase injection into the cerebrospinal fluid and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt)-induced hypertension. Male mice were divided into two groups: a resveratrol diet group and a normal diet group. The dietary intervention lasted for 6\u2009weeks, starting 3\u2009weeks prior to elastase injection. The overall incidence of aneurysms did not differ significantly between the normal diet and resveratrol diet groups (71% vs. 59%, p\u2009=\u20090.497). However, resveratrol significantly reduced the rate of aneurysmal rupture compared with that in the normal diet group (88% vs. 40%, p\u2009=\u20090.026). Furthermore, resveratrol supplementation increased the mRNA levels of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and decreased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (Nfkb1) and Tumor necrosis factor (Tnf). Our findings demonstrate that resveratrol reduces intracranial aneurysm rupture in a mouse model, indicating its therapeutic potential in this condition.",
