  "title": "Recent advances in encapsulation of resveratrol for enhanced delivery.",
  "abstract": "Due to its numerous biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-aging, anti-osteoporosis, anti-obesity, estrogenic, neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects, resveratrol has attracted a lot of attention in the food and pharmaceutical industries as a promising bioactive. However, low solubility in aqueous media, limited bioavailability, and low stability of resveratrol in hostile environments limit its applications. The necessity for a summary of recent developments is highlighted by the growing body of research on resveratrol encapsulation as a means of overcoming the mentioned application constraints. This review highlights the present developments in resveratrol delivery techniques, including spray drying, liposomes, emulsions, and nanoencapsulation. Bioaccessibility, bioavailability, stability, and release of resveratrol from encapsulating matrices are discussed. Future research should focus on encapsulation approaches with high loading capacity, targeted delivery, and controlled release. In light of the growing interest in resveratrol and the increasing complexity of resveratrol-based formulations, review of current encapsulation methods is crucial to address existing limitations and pave the way for the development of next-generation delivery systems. This review discusses how the delivery systems with different structures and release mechanisms can unlock the full potential and benefits of resveratrol by enhancing its bioavailability and stability.",
