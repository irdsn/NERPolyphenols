  "abstract": "Cold liquid stabulation aims to extract valuable compounds from grape lees before juice clarification. In this study, 7, 14, and 21\u00a0days of lees contact were tested on aroma-neutral 'Arneis' and 'Cortese' grape juices vs control. Basic parameters, colour, polyphenols, antioxidant capacity, and volatile organic compounds were assessed throughout winemaking. Wine sensory analysis was performed. The produced wines did not differ in terms of colour and show limited differences in polyphenols, not influencing astringency and bitterness. Variety and treatment length influenced free and glycosylated volatile organic compounds. Free terpenes increased in the 21-day treated 'Arneis' wine (+67\u00a0%). Lower free esters in 'Arneis' with 14 days of stabulation were found (-10\u00a0%). On the contrary, higher values of individual esters were found in 14 and 21-day treated 'Cortese' wines, but these showed lower free C6 (-12\u00a0%) and sulphur compounds (-23\u00a0% and\u00a0-\u00a024\u00a0%, respectively), and higher overall wine quality with respect to non-stabulated wine.",
