  "abstract": "Visceral obesity is a high-risk factor for diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been reported to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation. However, the effect of resveratrol on human visceral preadipocyte (HPA-v) differentiation remains largely unknown. LIM domain only 3 (LMO3) promotes human preadipocyte differentiation by enhancing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) transcriptional activity, which is the master regulator of adipogenesis. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of resveratrol (0-50\u2009\u03bcM) on HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, and the role of LMO3 in resveratrol-mediated regulation of HPA-v differentiation. Resveratrol inhibited HPA-v proliferation and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of PPARG, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (CEBPA), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at 10, 20, and 50\u2009\u03bcM. The mRNA and protein levels of LMO3 were significantly reduced by \u226520\u2009\u03bcM resveratrol (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and overexpression of LMO3 partially attenuated resveratrol-induced reduction of HPA-v differentiation by enhancing the PPARG transcriptional activity. Together, our study suggested that resveratrol reduced HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, as well as LMO3, which was partially responsible for the reduction of resveratrol-mediated adipocyte differentiation.",
