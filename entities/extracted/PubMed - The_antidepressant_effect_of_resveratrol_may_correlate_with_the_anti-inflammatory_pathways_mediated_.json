  "abstract": "Bitter substances, such as resveratrol, alleviate depression by curbing inflammation, yet the mechanisms involved are obscure, not to mention a unified mechanism. Our previous research implies that the type 2 bitter taste receptors (Tas2rs) signaling pathway is crucial for the anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol, potentially driving its antidepressant action. This study aims to illustrate the possible antidepressant mechanism of resveratrol via Tas2rs-mediated anti-inflammatory pathways which may reveal a common thread in therapeutic action of the bitter.",
