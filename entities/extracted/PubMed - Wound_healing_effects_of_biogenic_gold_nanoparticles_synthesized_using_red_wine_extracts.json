  "abstract": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using three red wine extracts (RW-Es); by varying temperature, pH, concentrations of RW-Es and gold salt. The RW-AuNPs were characterized by UV-vis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FT-IR). Their stability was evaluated in water, foetal bovine serum (FBS), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) by UV-Vis. The effect of the RW-Es and RW-AuNPs on KMST-6 cell cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay; and their wound healing effects were monitored by scratch assay. RW-AuNPs synthesis was observed by colour change, and confirmed by UV-Vis spectrum, with an absorption peak around 550\u2009nm. The hydrodynamic sizes of the RW-AuNPs ranged between 10 and 100\u2009nm. Polyphenols, carboxylic acids, and amino acids are some of functional groups in the RW-Es that were involved in the reduction of RW-AuNPs. The RW-AuNPs were stable in test solutions and showed no cytotoxicity to the KMST-6 cells up to 72\u2009h. AuNPs synthesized from Pinotage and Cabernet Sauvignon enhanced proliferation of KMST-6 cells and showed potential as wound healing agents. Further studies are required to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the potential wound-healing effect of the RW-AuNPs.",
