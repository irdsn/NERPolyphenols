  "abstract": "Amyloid deposits initiate neuroinflammation by activating astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus, increasing neuronal vulnerability and loss. Astrocytes, while essential for cerebral function, can contribute to neuronal dysfunction by retracting neuronal synapses, that forms a consequence of neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Upon Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition, astrocytes become reactive as part of a repair mechanism, however this process can impair neurogenesis resulting in AD progression.",
