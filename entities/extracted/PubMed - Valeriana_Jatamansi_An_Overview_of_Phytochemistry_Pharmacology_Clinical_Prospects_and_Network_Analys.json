  "abstract": "Valeriana jatamansiJones (V. jatamansi) has a long history of medicinal use owing to its significant therapeutic effects, particularly in the treatment of mental diseases such as depression, and on account of its cytotoxicity against various cancer cells. The chemical composition, pharmacological properties, and mechanisms ofV. jatamansihave been extensively explored in various studies published between 2017 and 2023 on major databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, and CNKI[Formula: see text] Investigations have identified 128 compounds including iridoids, sesquiterpenoids, volatile oils, lignans, and miscellaneous compounds based on their structural characteristics. Pharmacological research has documented its impact on the central nervous system, and its antitumor, gastroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. In particular, iridoids stand out among these compounds, and iridoid-enriched fraction fromV. jatamansi(IEFV), identified by several pharmacological experiments, exhibits notable protective properties against diseases of the central nervous system and several cancers. In summary,V. jatamansiholds potential as an adjunct in cancer treatment, enhancing its therapeutic efficacy.",
