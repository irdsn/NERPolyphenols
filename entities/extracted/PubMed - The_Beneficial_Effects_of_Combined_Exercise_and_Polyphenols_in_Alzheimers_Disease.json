  "abstract": "Regular exercise enhances life quality, lowers the risk of cognitive damage, and slows the advancement of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Natural compounds rich in polyphenols have garnered attention as a non-pharmacological means of treating and preventing AD. The primary component of wine, grape seeds, and nuts is polyphenols. Research suggests that polyphenols slow down the rate of neurodegeneration in AD and lessen learning impairment. Furthermore, polyphenols lessen brain impairments related to cognition. Additionally, polyphenols can specifically restructure amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) structures and soluble oligomers into non-toxic alternative species. They have also been revealed to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factors expression, suggesting that they have a positive impact on the creation of neurotrophins. The benefits of polyphenol supplementation and exercise, which can both provide neuroprotection, have not been well studied in AD patients. This review aimed to investigate the effects of combined exercise polyphenols on inflammation, neuroprotection, several conformational toxic species of A\u03b2, and A\u03b2-induced apoptosis in AD.",
