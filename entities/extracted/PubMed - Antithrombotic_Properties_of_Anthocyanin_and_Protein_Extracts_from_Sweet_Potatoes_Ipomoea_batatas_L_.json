  "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, with thrombosis playing a major role. Synthetic antithrombotic therapies often have adverse effects, highlighting the need for safer, natural alternatives. This study investigates the antithrombotic potential (antiplatelet and anticoagulant activities) and hemocompatibility of protein and anthocyanin extracts from sweet potato byproducts. Since polyphenol oxidase (PPO) can impact on the biological activity of these extracts, treatments to inactivate PPO were applied with ascorbic acid immersion and bleaching. Anthocyanin extract (1\u00a0mg/mL) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, and PMA. Both anthocyanin and protein extract prolonged coagulation times (aPTT, thrombin time, and fibrinogen assay) and exhibited no toxicity in hemolysis and cytotoxicity analyses. Additionally, anthocyanins reduced key platelet activation markers (P-selectin, CD63, fibrinogen). Ascorbic acid pre-treatment against PPO enhanced the biological activity of anthocyanins. This study demonstrates that sweet potato anthocyanins and proteins possess significant antithrombotic properties, offering potential as sustainable, natural alternatives to synthetic thrombosis treatments. Further studies are needed to explore their bioavailability, in vivo effects, and clinical applications.",
