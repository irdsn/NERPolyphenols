  "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, leading to organ dysfunction, high mortality, and morbidity. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has limited clinical application due to its poor solubility and bioavailability. To address these limitations, we designed and synthesized a novel quercetin \u03b2-aminobutyrate derivative, Quercetin-3-\u03b2-aminobutyrate (HPS-\u03b2), using a prodrug strategy. HPS-\u03b2 demonstrated a 17,500-fold increase in phosphate buffer solubility and significantly improved bioavailability compared to quercetin. In vitro studies revealed that HPS-\u03b2 effectively suppressed macrophage activation, reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), and mitigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. In vivo experiments using LPS-induced septic mice showed that HPS-\u03b2 improved survival rates, lowered serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorated sepsis-related lung injury and the disruption of intestinal barrier integrity. Importantly, HPS-\u03b2 exhibited no apparent toxicity to major organs. Mechanistically, HPS-\u03b2 exerted its therapeutic effects by inhibiting oxidative stress and reducing inflammatory cytokine release. These findings highlight HPS-\u03b2 as a promising therapeutic candidate for sepsis treatment, offering improved solubility, bioavailability, and efficacy compared to quercetin.",
