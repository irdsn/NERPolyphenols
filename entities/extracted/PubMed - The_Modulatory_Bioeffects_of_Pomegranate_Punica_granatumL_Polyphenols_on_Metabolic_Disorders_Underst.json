  "abstract": "Modern research achievements support the health-promoting effects of natural products and diets rich in polyphenols. Pomegranate (PG) (Punica granatumL.) contains a considerable number of bioactive compounds that exert a broad spectrum of beneficial biological activities, including antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antiobesity, and atheroprotective properties. In this context, the reviewed literature shows that PG intake might reduce insulin resistance, cytokine levels, redox gene expression, blood pressure elevation, vascular injuries, and lipoprotein oxidative modifications. The lipid parameter corrective capabilities of PG-ellagitannins have also been extensively reported to be significantly effective in reducing hyperlipidemia (TC, LDL-C, VLDL-C, and TAGs), while increasing plasma HDL-C concentrations and improving the TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios. The health benefits of pomegranate consumption seem to be acheived through the amelioration of adipose tissue endocrine function, fatty acid utilization, GLUT receptor expression, paraoxonase activity enhancement, and the modulation of PPAR and NF-\u03baB. While the results from animal experiments are promising, human findings published in this field are inconsistent and are still limited in several aspects. The present review aims to discuss and provide a critical analysis of PG's bioeffects on the components of metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as on certain cardiovascular-related diseases. Additionally, a brief overview of the pharmacokinetic properties, safety, and bioavailability of PG-ellagitannins is included.",
