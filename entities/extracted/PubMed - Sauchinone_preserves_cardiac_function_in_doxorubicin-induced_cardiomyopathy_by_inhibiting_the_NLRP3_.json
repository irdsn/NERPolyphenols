  "abstract": "Doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC) is characterized by severe myocardial damage that can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy and potentially lead to heart failure. No effective prevention or treatment strategies are available for DIC. Sauchinone, a diastereomeric lignan isolated from Saururus chinensis, is known for its notable anti-inflammatory effects. However, a paucity of research on sauchinone in relation to heart disease exists, particularly regarding its role in DIC, which remains unclear.",
