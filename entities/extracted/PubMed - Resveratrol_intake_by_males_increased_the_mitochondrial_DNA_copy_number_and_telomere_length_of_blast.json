  "abstract": "The present study examined whether male resveratrol intake affected mitochondrial DNA copy number (mt-cn) and telomere length (TL) in blastocysts fathered by young and aged male mice. C57BL/6N male mice supplied with water or water containing 0.1 mM resveratrol were used for embryo production at 14-23 and 48-58 weeks of age. Two-cell-stage embryos were collected from the oviducts of superovulated female mice (8-15 weeks old) and cultured for 3 days until the blastocyst stage. Mt-cn and TL levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Resveratrol intake did not affect body weight or water consumption. Resveratrol intake increased the expression levels of SIRT1 in the liver, the antioxidative ability of serum, and extended TL in the heart, whereas there was no significant difference in mt-cn in the heart or TL in sperm. The rate of blastocyst development was significantly lower in aged male mice than in younger mice, and resveratrol intake increased the total number of blastocysts derived from both young and aged males. Resveratrol intake did not affect mt-cn or TL in blastomeres of blastocyst-stage embryos derived from young mice, but significantly increased both mt-cn and TL in blastomeres of blastocysts derived from aged fathers. In conclusion, resveratrol intake increased mt-cn and TL levels in blastocysts derived from aged male mice.",
