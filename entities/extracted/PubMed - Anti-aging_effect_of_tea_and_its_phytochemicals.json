  "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable biological process characterized by the progressive decline of physiological functions and an increased susceptibility to age-related diseases. As one of the world's most consumed beverages, tea is renowned not only for its rich flavor but also for its diverse health benefits. Abundant in bioactive compounds, tea exhibits a wide range of therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, cardioprotective, and anticancer effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that tea and its functional components hold significant promise as potential anti-aging interventions. Epidemiological studies indicate that regular tea consumption may mitigate the adverse effects of aging and alleviate symptoms of age-related disorders. These benefits are primarily attributed to tea's ability to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, modulate mitochondrial function and nutrient-sensing pathways, maintain gut microbiota homeostasis, inhibit telomere shortening and cellular senescence, and enhance autophagy. This review comprehensively examines the interplay between tea, its bioactive constituents, and their multifaceted roles in extending lifespan, ameliorating age-related diseases, and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. By elucidating the scientific basis of tea's anti-aging properties, we aim to provide valuable insights for future research and the development of novel strategies to promote healthy aging.",
