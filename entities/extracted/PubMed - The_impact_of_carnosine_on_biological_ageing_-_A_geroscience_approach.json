  "abstract": "Biological ageing involves a gradual decline in physiological function and resilience, marked by molecular, cellular, and systemic changes across organ systems. Geroscience, an interdisciplinary field, studies these mechanisms and their role in age-related diseases. Genomic instability, inflammation, telomere attrition, and other indicators contribute to conditions like cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. Geroscience identifies geroprotectors, such as resveratrol and metformin, targeting ageing pathways to extend the healthspan. Carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide (b-alanine and l-histidine), has emerged as a potential geroprotector with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-glycating properties. Carnosine's benefits extend to muscle function, exercise performance, and cognitive health, making it a promising therapeutic intervention for healthy ageing and oxidative stress-related pathologies. In this review, we summarize the evidence describing carnosine's effects in promoting healthy ageing, providing new insights into improving geroscience.",
