  "abstract": "Despite the technologies applied to food production, microbial contamination and chemical deterioration are still matters of great concern. In order to limit these phenomena, new natural approaches should be applied. In this context, the present study aimed to assess the antioxidant and anti-Clostridial effects of two different polyphenolic extracts derived from olive mill vegetation water, one liquid (LE) and one encapsulated (EE). The extracts have been preliminary characterized using Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time-Of Flight spectrometry. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity method was used to determine the antioxidant capacity, registering a higher value for EE compared to that for LE (3256 \u00b1 85 and 2446 \u00b1 13 \u00b5gTE/g, respectively). The antibacterial activity againstC. perfringens,C. botulinumandC. difficilewas studied by the agar well diffusion method, MIC and MBC determination and a time-kill test. The results confirm that EE and LE are able to limit microbial growth, albeit with minor effects when the phenolic compounds are encapsulated. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible application of these extracts in food systems.",
