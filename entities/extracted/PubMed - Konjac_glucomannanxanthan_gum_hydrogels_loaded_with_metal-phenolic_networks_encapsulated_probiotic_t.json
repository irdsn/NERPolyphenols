  "abstract": "Probiotic hydrogel systems have been reported to promote healing of infected wounds by secreting functional bioactive secondary metabolites (BSM) of probiotics. Herein, Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), a probiotic, are encapsulated via a metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) and loaded into konjac glucomannan/xanthan gum-based hydrogels for wound repair. This MPNs were designed and composed of Bletilla striata polysaccharide, procyanidin, Ca2+, which can enhance the cross-linking through hydrogen bonding to form the KGXM-PCB@Bsubtilis hydrogel, protects the probiotic from antibiotics and prevents B. subtilis from escaping into the wound microenvironment, thereby avoiding exposure to a possible threat. Moreover, the KGXM-PCB@Bsubtilis hydrogel not only exhibits superior mechanical characteristics and biocompatibility, but also shows excellent antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, remove the active oxygens, and promote cell migration. In vivo experiments showed that after treatment with the KGXM-PCB@Bsubtilis hydrogel, the wound healing rate reached 98.31\u00a0% on day 14, and collagen deposition was highly expressed (81.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.20\u00a0%), which promoted wound healing and regeneration of new tissue. This study provides new ideas for developing wound dressings based on living bacterial hydrogels.",
