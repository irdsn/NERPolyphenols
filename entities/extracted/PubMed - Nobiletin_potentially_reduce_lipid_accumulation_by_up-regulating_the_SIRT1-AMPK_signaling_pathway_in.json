  "abstract": "The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising at an alarming rate, making it a major global public health problem. The main pathophysiology of NAFLD is elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in hepatocytes which leads to lipid accumulation. Because of their function in controlling DNL, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) have been considered viable therapy targets for reduce lipid accumulation.",
