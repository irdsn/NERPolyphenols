  "abstract": "Rhizome of Gastrodia elata Blume (RGE) is a valuable traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the clinical practice. The Compendium of Materia Medica records that RGE has the effect of flatting liver wind out. It has sedative, analgesic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, anti-hypertensive, anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-arrhythmic and anti-platelet aggregation effects. RGE is often used to relieve and treat vertigo, headache, hypertension, convulsions, and epilepsy in TCM clinic for thousands of years. Accumulated evidences have suggested that hypertension disease is related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) disturbance. However, the potential pharmacodynamic components and anti-hypertensive mechanisms of RGE are unclear now.",
