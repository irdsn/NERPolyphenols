  "abstract": "Dry matter of Baneh gum (DMBG)-based smart films were developed by incorporating of elongated turnip anthocyanins (ElTAs) to monitoring of chicken wings spoilage. The ElTAs solution displayed pH-responsive color-varying features with distinguishable volatile-amines identifying. The thickness of the films ranged from 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 to 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcm. The addition of ElTAs into the films matrix resulted in an increase of tensile strength (TS) and a decrease of elongation at break (EAB%) and moisture content (MC%), respectively. Microstructure analyses showed a smooth and compact surface morphology of the film's matrix and that ElTAs were dispersed within it. The stability properties of the films were evaluated in different storage environments over a period of 4\u00a0months. The highest color stability is achieved in the dark environment. The films showed that after 2 and 4\u00a0months of keeping, preserve the reusability property of color changes to detect of ammonia. The performance of film in monitoring the freshness chicken wings was evaluated. The TVB-N value of the chicken wings gradually increased to the rejection limit of >25\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g for 21\u00a0h. The smart films, with utilizable features are useful in providing food safety, and extending for evaluation of the food quality.",
