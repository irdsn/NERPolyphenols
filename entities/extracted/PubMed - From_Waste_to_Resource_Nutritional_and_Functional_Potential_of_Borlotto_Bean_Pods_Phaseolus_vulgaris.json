  "title": "From Waste to Resource: Nutritional and Functional Potential of Borlotto Bean Pods (Phaseolus vulgarisL.).",
  "abstract": "Borlotto bean pods, a by-product ofPhaseolus vulgarisprocessing, represent a promising yet underexplored source of bioactive compounds. This study aimed to characterize the nutritional composition, phytochemical profile, and biological properties of a food-grade extract obtained from borlotto bean pods (BPE). Nutritional parameters were assessed using standard AOAC methods, while primary and secondary metabolites were identified and semi-quantified via1H-NMR and LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. Antioxidant activity was evaluated through six complementary assays: DPPH, TEAC, FRAP, ORAC, ferrous ion-chelating activity, and \u03b2-carotene bleaching inhibition. Anti-inflammatory potential was assessed in vitro by evaluating the inhibition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation and protease activity. BPE showed significant antioxidant capacity across all assays, indicating both hydrogen atom transfer and electron transfer mechanisms, along with metal chelation and lipid peroxidation inhibition. Additionally, BPE inhibited protein denaturation and protease activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results highlight the potential of borlotto bean pods as a sustainable source of nutritionally and functionally relevant compounds. Future studies should focus on the bioavailability of active constituents, formulation into delivery systems, and in vivo validation to support potential nutraceutical applications.",
