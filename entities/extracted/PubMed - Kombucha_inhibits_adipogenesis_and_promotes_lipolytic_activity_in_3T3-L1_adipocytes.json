  "abstract": "This research was conducted to investigate the anti-obesity effects of black tea or green tea kombucha (BK, GK) and compared their compositional differences. As a result of kombucha treatment during the adipocyte differentiation process, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 was significantly decreased, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1 and adipocyte protein 2 showed a tendency to decrease with BK treatment. Oil red O staining results also demonstrated a reduction of lipid accumulation by BK treatment compared to the control. In mature adipocytes, BK significantly upregulated the gene expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and tended to increase the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and adiponectin. Additionally, as a biomarker of lipolysis, glycerol content also marginally increased with either BK or GK treatment. The differences were observed in tea polyphenol compound and organic acid contents between BK and GK. In conclusion, these results suggest that black tea kombucha may have anti-obesity activity.",
