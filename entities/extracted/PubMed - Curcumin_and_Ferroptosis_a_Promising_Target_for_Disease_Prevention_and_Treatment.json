  "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a recently identified form of cell death characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Unlike apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, ferroptosis operates through a distinct molecular pathway. Curcumin, derived from turmeric rhizomes, is a natural compound with diverse therapeutic benefits, including neuroprotective, anti-metabolic syndrome, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. Growing evidence suggests that curcumin possesses both pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties, which can vary depending on the cell type. In this review, we explore the relationship between the effects of curcumin and the molecular mechanisms underlying the ferroptosis signaling pathway, drawing from current in vivo and in vitro research. Curcumin has been found to induce ferroptosis in cancer cells while acting as an inhibitor of ferroptosis in tissue injuries. Notably, curcumin treatment leads to alterations in key ferroptosis markers, underscoring its significant impact on this process. Nonetheless, further research focused on elucidating this important attribute of turmeric is crucial for advancing disease treatment.",
