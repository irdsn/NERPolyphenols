  "abstract": "Potential for pulse proteins in plant-based meat alternatives is limited by weak protein polymer interactions. This work examined the effects of proanthocyanidins on pulse protein crosslinking. Proanthocyanidins with degree of polymerization, mDP, 1-19.5 were reacted with soybean (control) and pulse (pea, faba, and lentil) proteins. Changes in properties, MW, and post-extrusion texture were evaluated. Pea and faba proteins exhibited stronger proanthocyanidin binding (Kd, 3.13-8.74), but lower binding capacity (Bmax, 0.29), and change in surface hydrophobicity, (\u0394Ho, -56\u00a0%) vs soy and lentil (Kd, 249-935, Bmax,0.59-0.76, \u0394Ho, -67\u00a0%). Polymeric proanthocyanidins preferentially cross-linked high MWprotein subunits, forming complexes of >600\u00a0kDa and increasing protein denaturation temperature by 2.9-12.1\u00a0\u00b0C. The proanthocyanidins increased hardness (1.8-15\u00d7) and chewiness (1.6-13\u00d7) of texturized pulse proteins, suggesting increased protein network density during extrusion. The findings highlight the potential of proanthocyanidins to enhance pulse protein polymer interactions and improve their textural properties.",
