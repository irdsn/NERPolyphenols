  "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common disease of the nervous system. Recent advances in epigenetics have revealed DNA methylation as a key mechanism in epilepsy pathogenesis, particularly through dysregulation of GABAergic signaling. Baicalein has been shown to have anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects. However, its epigenetic regulatory effects on GABA receptor function remain unexplored.",
