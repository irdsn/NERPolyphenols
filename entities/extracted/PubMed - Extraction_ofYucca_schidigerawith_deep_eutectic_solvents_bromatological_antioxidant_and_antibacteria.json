  "abstract": "Infections caused byEscherichiacoli,Staphylococcus aureus,SalmonellaTyphimurium, andListeria monocytogenesare linked to contaminated food or water, while antibiotic resistance limits treatment options. Plant extracts are considered potential alternatives, and deep eutectic solvents and natural deep eutectic solvents (DES and NADES) offer a sustainable approach to metabolite extraction.Yucca schidigerapowder was extracted using butanol (YSBE) and a NADES composed of choline chloride and lactic acid at a 1:1 molar ratio (YS-NADES). Bromatological composition, saponin content, total phenols and flavonoids, emulsifying and foaming capacities, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial properties were analyzed. YSBE contained 25.43% saponins, while YS-NADES had 0.093%. YSBE had higher protein (0.73%) and carbohydrate (77.5%) content than YS-NADES (0.03% and 0.95%, respectively). Antioxidant activity (DPPH, TEAC, ORAC) was significantly higher in YSBE than in YS-NADES. Phenol and flavonoid concentrations were also greater in YSBE.E. colishowed less sensitivity to both extracts thanS. Typhimurium,S. aureus, andL. monocytogenes, whileS. Typhimurium was less sensitive to YS-NADES. This study provides insights into the bromatological composition, antioxidant potential, and antibacterial properties ofY. schidigeraextracted with NADES, highlighting its potential applications.",
