  "abstract": "Akebia species including,A. trifoliata(AKT),A. trifoliatassp. australis (AKA), andA. quinata(AKQ) are popular for their sweet, aromatic fruits and pharmacological applications. Despite their commercial and medicinal importance, the metabolomic profiles of Akebia pulp remain largely unexplored. This study employs UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS techniques to comprehensively analyze the chemical composition of the pulp from these three species. Among the 1429 metabolites detected and putatively identified, terpenoids, amino acids, flavonoids, and phenolics were predominant. AKT shows the richest bioactive compound accumulation, including significant levels of L-Isoleucyl-l-Aspartate, 6-C-Methylquercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and Madasiatic acid, suggesting its high nutritional and medicinal value. AKA has the lowest metabolite accumulation, while AKQ displays an intermediate profile with notable antioxidants like Quercetin-3-O-xyloside. These findings provide a foundation for optimizing the cultivation, harvesting, and utilization of Akebia fruits and underscore their potential for developing functional foods and nutraceuticals.",
