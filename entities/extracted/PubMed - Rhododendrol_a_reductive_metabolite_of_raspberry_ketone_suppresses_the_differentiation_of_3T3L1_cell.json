  "abstract": "Obesity is a serious medical condition worldwide, and a major risk factor for type\u00a02 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer and cardiovascular disease. In addition to changes in dietary habits and physical activity, consuming supplements to maintain good health and prevent obesity is important in modern society. Raspberry ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic ketone found in the European red raspberry (Rubus idaeusL.) and is hypothesized to prevent obesity when administered orally. The present study found that RK was reduced to rhododendrol (ROH) in human liver microsomes and cytosol. The present study investigated whether the metabolite ROH had anti\u2011adipogenic effects using mouse 3T3\u2011L1 cells. The effects of ROH or RK on lipid accumulation during differentiation of 3T3\u2011L1 pre\u2011adipocyte into adipocyte were determined using Oil Red O staining. CCAAT enhancer\u2011binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator\u2011activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) mRNA and protein expression were examined using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and western blotting analysis, respectively. The present study revealed that ROH suppressed lipid accumulation in the cells, similar to RK. In addition, ROH suppressed the mRNA expression levels of C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 in 3T3\u2011L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, ROH suppressed PPAR\u03b3 protein expression in 3T3\u2011L1 adipocytes. These findings suggested that ROH is an active metabolite with an anti\u2011adipogenic effect, which may contribute to the anti\u2011obesity effect of orally administered RK. The present study indicated that it is important to understand the biological activity of the metabolites of orally administered compounds.",
