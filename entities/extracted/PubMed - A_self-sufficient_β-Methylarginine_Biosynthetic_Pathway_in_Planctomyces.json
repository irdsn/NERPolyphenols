  "abstract": "\u03b2-Methylamino acids (\u03b2-MAAs) enhance the bioactivity of natural products and possess intrinsic pharmacological properties as free amino acids. While the biosynthetic capacity for this class of non-canonical amino acids has been established in certain bacterial lineages such as Gammaproteobacteria and Actinomycetes, other bacterial phyla remain largely unexplored. Here we report the genome-mining guided discovery of a novel biosynthetic gene cluster capable of producing \u03b2-methylarginine, from the phylum Planctomycetes. We provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence that Planctomycetes employ a transaminase (PlaA) and a methyltransferase (PlaB) to synthesize this \u03b2-MAA. Unlike previously described \u03b2-methylarginine biosynthetic pathways, PlaA and PlaB function as a self-sufficient enzyme cascade that operates without the need for additional keto acid and amino acid partners. These findings expand the catalytic repertoire for \u03b2-MAAs biosynthesis and establish Planctomycetes as a new source of secondary metabolites discovery.",
