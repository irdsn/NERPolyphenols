  "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge, necessitating innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence such as clinical trials suggests that the combination of exercise and polyphenol intake exerts synergistic effects in mitigating breast cancer progression by modulating key molecular pathways. Exercise enhances immune function, reduces inflammation, and regulates cellular metabolism, while polyphenols, natural compounds found in various plant-based foods, exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Together, these interventions influence apoptosis, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis which play crucial roles in breast cancer pathophysiology. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the combined impact of exercise and polyphenols on breast cancer prevention and treatment. Understanding the interplay between exercise and polyphenols at the molecular level could pave the way for novel, non-invasive therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on optimizing exercise regimens and dietary interventions to maximize their anti-cancer benefits. By bridging molecular insights with clinical applications, this review aims to provide a foundation for incorporating lifestyle-based interventions into breast cancer management. Our findings collectively highlight the promising potential of combining curcumin supplementation with exercise as a multifaceted approach to breast cancer treatment. The synergistic effects observed in various studies suggest that integrating lifestyle modifications with dietary interventions may enhance therapeutic efficacy and mitigate cancer progression. Further clinical investigations are warranted to validate these results and explore their applicability in human subjects. The evidence supports a holistic strategy for breast cancer management that could improve patient outcomes and quality of life during treatment.",
