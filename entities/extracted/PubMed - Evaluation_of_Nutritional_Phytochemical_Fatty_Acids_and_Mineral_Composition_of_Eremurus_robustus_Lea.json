  "abstract": "One of the wild herbs that grows naturally in the springtime in Kurdistan's mountainous regions is Eremurus robustus. The study aimed to detect the proximate analysis, polyphenols, fatty acid profile, and mineral composition in the leaves of Eremurus robustus. Proximate composition revealed it is a source of vitamin C, fiber, and protein. Nine phenolic compounds and 24 fatty acids were detected, along with 14 saturated and 10 unsaturated fatty acids using high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-LC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometers (GC-MS). Seventeen mineral compositions were found using an inductively coupled spectrophotometric technique. Vegetable trace metal concentrations can be assessed by comparing the daily diets of plants and humans. The research suggests that Eremurus robustus leaves can serve as nutritional supplements and functional foods, not just for therapeutic uses.",
