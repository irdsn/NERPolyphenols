  "title": "Dietary flavonoids in health and diseases: A concise review of their role in homeostasis and therapeutics.",
  "abstract": "Over the past few decades, extensive research has delved into the health advantages of flavonoids, exploring their physiological effects through cell-based assays, epidemiological studies, and human intervention trials. The regular intake of plant-derived flavonoids has shown therapeutic potential against noncommunicable pathophysiological conditions, including carcinoma and various inflammatory disorders. Among the myriads of flavonoids, many have been shown to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides in Alzheimer's disease, while anthocyanins exhibit cardioprotective effects by improving endothelial function and lowering blood pressure. In addition, their efficacy is known to manage infectious communicable diseases caused by various bacteria and viruses, such as S. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2. Currently, flavonoids are being used to develop new drugs for both communicable and noncommunicable diseases because of their intricate metabolism and bioavailability, leveraging their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This concise review provides insights into the potential of flavonoids for therapeutics and disease management, particularly with respect to cardiovascular health, neuroprotection, and antimicrobial action. The implications of these findings underscore the necessity for further exploration of flavonoid-rich diets and their incorporation into therapeutic practices to harness their full health benefits.",
