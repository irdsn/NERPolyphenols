  "abstract": "Two new diastereoisomeric tetrahydrofuranoid-lignans (1and2) were purified fromTaxus wallichiana(Taxaceae) roots. Their respective structures were subsequently determined through spectroscopic analysis, together with GIAO NMR chemical shift calculation and DP4+ probability method to assign the relative configurations. A respective assignment of 7R,8R,7'R,8'Rand 7R,8R,7'S,8'Rwas given for their absolute configurations, based on a comparative analysis between measured and calculated ECD data. Compounds1and2were examined for their\u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effect, and their corresponding IC50values were 57.2 and 185.6\u03bcM, respectively, indicating greater potency than acarbose the positive control with IC50= 214.5\u03bcM.",
