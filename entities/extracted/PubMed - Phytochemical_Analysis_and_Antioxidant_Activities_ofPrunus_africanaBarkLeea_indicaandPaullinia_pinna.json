  "abstract": "The phytochemical profile and antioxidant activities ofPrunus africanabark,Leea indicaandPaullinia pinnataleaves from Cameroon were investigated in this study. The yields of pure methanolic extraction were 11.9%, 11.1% and 10.8% inP. africanabark,L. indicaandP. pinnataleaves, respectively. The total phenolic content was 189.0 \u00b1 16.93, 163.6 \u00b1 14.73 and 114.6 \u00b1 10.38 mg GAE/g and total flavonoid content was 43.25 \u00b1 6.43, 28.31 \u00b1 4.44, and 19.75 \u00b1 4.03 mg RU/g inP. africanabark,L. indicaandP. pinnataleaves, respectively. The antioxidant activities of the plants were evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays. The IC50evaluated inP. africanabark,L. indicaandP. pinnataleaves was 109.5 \u00b1 13.2, 132.1 \u00b1 18.7 and 156.1 \u00b1 21.9 \u00b5g/mL for DPPH and 98.1 \u00b1 4.8, 101.3 \u00b1 12.1 and 133.9 \u00b1 16.0 \u00b5g /mL for ABTS assay. The FRAP value was 61.1 \u00b1 1.5, 50.5 \u00b1 1.5 and 43.4 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5MFe2+/g in the same sequence. The functional groups for the corresponding phytochemicals, including alkane, alkene, aliphatic ether, ester, amine, \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ester, alcohol, phenol, carboxylic acid, and aliphatic ketone, were identified through fourier-transform infrared analysis. The identified and quantified phenolic acids in this study were methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, protocatechuic and p-coumaric acid, identified using high-performance liquid chromatography.",
