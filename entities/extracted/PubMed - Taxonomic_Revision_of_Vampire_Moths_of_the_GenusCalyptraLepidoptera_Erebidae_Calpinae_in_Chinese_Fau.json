  "abstract": "CalyptraOchsenheimer, 1816 is an important genus of fruit piercers and blood feeders with 18 described species worldwide. Both sexes of allCalyptraspecies pierce fruit. Adults feed upon and damage soft-skinned (e.g.,RubusandVitis) and thicker-skinned fruits (e.g.,FicusandCitrus) in subtropical and tropical Asia. These moths are rare examples of a lepidopteran lineage that uses its fruit-piercing mouthparts to pierce the skin of vertebrate animals occasionally. In China, 10 species of this genus have been reported. Here, we identified seven species of the genusCalyptraOchsenheimer, 1816 from Chinese fauna, includingC. gruesa,C. thalictri,C. hokkaida,C. albivirgata,C. orthograpta,C. fletcheri, andC. lata. Detailed illustrations of male and female external morphology and genital structures are provided. A comprehensive worldwide checklist of the genusCalyptrais also included. This study highlights significant taxonomic revisions and morphological features for this genus within Chinese fauna.",
