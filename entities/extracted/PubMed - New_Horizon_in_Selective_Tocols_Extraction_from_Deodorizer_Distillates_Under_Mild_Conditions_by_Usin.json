  "title": "New Horizon in Selective Tocols Extraction from Deodorizer Distillates Under Mild Conditions by Using Deep Eutectic Solvents.",
  "abstract": "Tocols are commonly known as vitamin E, which comprise tocopherols and tocotrienols. Although vegetable oils are natural sources of tocols, deodorizer distillates (DDs) are attractive feedstock due to their potential abundance from oil refining processes and economic price. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a family of neoteric solvents that show promising performance for tocols extraction. Besides their characters occupying the green chemistry concept, this review presents the current research on the potential performances of DESs in extracting tocols selectively and efficiently from DDs. The application of DESs in tocols extraction is presented considering three different ways: mono-phasic, in situ DESs formation, and bi-phasic systems. The basic principles of intermolecular interactions (H-bond, van der Walls bond, and misfit interaction) between DESs or their components with tocols are discussed to understand the mechanism by which DESs selectively extract tocols from the mixture. This is mainly observed to be a function of the intrinsic properties of DESs and/or tocols, which could be beneficial for tuning the appropriate DESs for extracting tocols selectively and effectively under mild operation conditions. This review is expected to provide insight in the potential application of DESs in the extracting of natural compounds with a phenolic structure and also briefly discusses the toxicity of DESs.",
