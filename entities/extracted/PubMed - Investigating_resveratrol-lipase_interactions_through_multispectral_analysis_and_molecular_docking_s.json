  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenol with diverse pharmacological properties, has shown potential in modulating lipid metabolism through interactions with lipase (LPS). This study employed multispectral techniques and molecular docking to characterize the RES-LPS interaction mechanism quantitatively. Fluorescence quenching analysis revealed static quenching with a binding constant (KA) of 7.499\u2009\u00d7\u2009105L\u00b7mol-1at 298\u2009K, supported by thermodynamic parameters (\u0394G=\u2009-40.43\u2009kJ\u00b7mol-1, \u0394H=\u2009-44.26\u2009kJ\u00b7mol-1, \u0394S=\u2009-135.5\u2009J\u00b7mol-1\u00b7K-1), indicating spontaneous, exothermic binding driven by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. UV-vis spectroscopy demonstrated a 2\u2009nm redshift in LPS's absorption peak, confirming complex formation. Circular dichroism revealed RES-induced secondary structural changes in LPS, with \u03b1-helix content decreasing from 17.2% to 17.0% and random coils increasing from 41.6% to 42.9%. Molecular docking identified key binding residues (ARG256, ASP79, TRP252) and a binding free energy of -3.86\u2009kcal\u00b7mol-1, validating the experimental findings. These results provide a mechanistic basis for RES's role in lipid metabolism regulation and its potential therapeutic applications.",
