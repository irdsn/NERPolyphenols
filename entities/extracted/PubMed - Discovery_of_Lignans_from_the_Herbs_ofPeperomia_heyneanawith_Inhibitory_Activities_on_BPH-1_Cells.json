  "abstract": "Chemical investigation on the whole herb ofPeperomia heyneanaMiq. resulted in the isolation of six lignans, including two previously undescribed compounds, named peperomianan A and B (1-2), and four known compounds, 1,2-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid (3), (+)-medioresinol (4), (+)-pinoresinol (5), and (+)-yangambin (6). Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analyses. The absolute configuration of compound1was determined by comparison of the experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Subsequently, the effects of all isolates on BPH-1 cells were evaluated in vitro by MTT assay.",
