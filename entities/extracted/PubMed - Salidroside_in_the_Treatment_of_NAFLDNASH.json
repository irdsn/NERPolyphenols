  "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest reason for chronic liver diseases in the world and is commonly related to the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a deteriorating form of NAFLD, which can eventually develop into fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. The reason for NAFLD/NASH development is complicated, such as liver lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis and autophagy, liver fibrosis and gut microbiota. Apart from bariatric surgery and lifestyle changes, officially approved drug therapy for NAFLD/NASH treatment is lacking. Salidroside (SDS) is a phenolic compound extensively distributed in the tubers of Rhodiola plants, which possesses many significant biological activities. This review summarized the related targets regulated by SDS in treating NAFLD/NASH. It is indicated that SDS could improve the status of NAFLD/NASH by ameliorating abnormal lipid metabolism, inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating apoptosis and autophagy, reducing inflammatory response, alleviating fibrosis and regulating gut microbiota. In conclusion, although the multiple bioactivities of SDS have been confirmed, the clinical data are inadequate and need to become the focus of attention in the later study.",
