  "abstract": "As two pivotal regulatory factors in cancer biology, oxidative stress and inflammation interact dynamically through complex network mechanisms to influence tumor initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. Oxidative stress induces genomic instability, oncogenic signaling activation, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling via the abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Conversely, inflammation sustains malignant phenotypes by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and promoting immune cell infiltration. These processes create a vicious cycle via positive feedback loops whereby oxidative stress initiates inflammatory signaling, while the inflammatory milieu further amplifies ROS/RNS production, collectively promoting proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and immune evasion in tumor cells. Moreover, their crosstalk modulates DNA damage repair, metabolic reprogramming, and drug efflux pump activity, significantly impacting the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. This review systematically discusses these advances and the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation in cancer biology. It also explores their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic indicators and highlights novel therapeutic strategies targeting the oxidative stress-inflammation axis. The goal is to provide a theoretical framework and translational roadmap for developing synergistic anti-tumor therapies.",
