  "abstract": "The diminutive recognized fruitMyrciaria dubia, innate to the Amazon, has only newly attained nutritional superstar status due to its dense content of bioactive compounds. Despite its potential, processing concerns, unsustainable fabrication, and a deficiency of experimental trials hinder its broader application. This review aimed to highlight the nutritional composition, pharmacological properties, and industrial applications ofMyrciaria dubia, emphasizing its potential as a functional ingredient in various sectors. The bioactive profile ofMyrciaria dubiacomprises vitamin C, polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid, contributing to its metabolic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial actions. Comparative analyses suggest its bioavailability and beneficial activity surpass those of other fruits, making it a strong candidate for functional foods, beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Given its promising attributes, further investigation and biotechnological advancements are necessary to enhance its bioactive content and ensure its sustainable integration into global markets. This review brings to the forefront the importance ofMyrciaria dubiaas a tool for addressing modern health challenges while supporting biodiversity conservation.",
