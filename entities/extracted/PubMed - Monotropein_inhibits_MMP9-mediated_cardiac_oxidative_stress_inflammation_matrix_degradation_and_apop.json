  "abstract": "Sepsis can cause severe cardiac damage, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is involved in the inflammatory response and tissue injury processes. Monotropein is a monoterpene glycoside with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. This study aims to investigate whether monotropein can alleviate sepsis-induced cardiac injury by affecting the activity of MMP9.",
