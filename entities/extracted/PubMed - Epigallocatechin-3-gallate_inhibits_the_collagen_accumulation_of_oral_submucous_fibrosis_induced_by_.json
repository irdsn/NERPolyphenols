  "abstract": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic oral mucosal disease, which exerts a profound impact on patients' daily life and currently lacks efficacious therapeutic interventions. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the abundant polyphenol found in green tea, exhibits remarkable anti-fibrotic effects on the skin. However, the research on OSF regarding EGCG is relatively limited.",
