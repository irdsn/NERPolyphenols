  "title": "Green coffee: economic relevance and a systematic review of the effects on human health.",
  "abstract": "Coffee is probably the most popular beverage after water and is an important component in diet and health since its consumption is high worldwide. Globally, it is the most relevant food commodity being just behind crude oil. Besides its pleasant flavor, it is an antioxidant source due to polyphenols, which are protective compounds against several diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the economic relevance and perform a systematic review of green coffee's effects on human health. Databases such as MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR were searched, and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Green coffee is considered a novel food product because consumers usually consume only roasted coffee. It can be marketed as such or as an extract. Due to the content of bioactive compounds, which are partially lost during the roasting process, the extracts are usually marketed concerning the potential regarding health effects. Green coffee can be used as dietary supplements, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, as a source of antioxidants. It can benefit human health, such as improvement in blood pressure, plasma lipids, and body weight (thus contributing to the improvement of risk components of Metabolic Syndrome). Moreover, benefits for cognitive functions may also be included.",
