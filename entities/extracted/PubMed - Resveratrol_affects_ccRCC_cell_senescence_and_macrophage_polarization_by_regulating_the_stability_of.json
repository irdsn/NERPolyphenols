  "abstract": "Aim:The present study sought to investigate the therapeutic effect of resveratrol on clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Materials & methods:Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays were used to verify the cell proliferation. Transwell, real-time quantitative transcription PCR, western blot and \u03b2-galactosidase staining were used to verify the migration, macrophage polarization and senescence. The tumor inhibitory effect of resveratrol on clear cell renal cell carcinoma was verifiedin vivo.Results:This study confirmed that resveratrol could affect the stability ofCCNB1mRNA\u00a0mediated by RBM15 and inhibit the cancer process by inhibiting the expression of EP300/CBP from the perspective of cell senescence.Conclusion:Resveratrol is able to treat clear cell renal cell carcinoma through RBM15-induced cell senescence.",
