  "abstract": "We aimed to determine and compare the cytotoxic effects of curcumin (Cur), gingerol (Gin), berberine (Ber), resveratrol (Res), baicalin (Bai), and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) both individually and in combination, across MCF-7, 3T3, A549, PC-12, and HT-29\u00a0cell lines. The findings also showed that IC50 values were not achieved for Bai and EGCG in all exposed cell lines. Furthermore, Cur was the most potent cytotoxic agent in monotherapy. In combination therapy, the Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Res combination indicated the most inhibitory effect in MCF-7\u00a0cells. The most inhibitory effects were for Res\u00a0+\u00a0Bai and Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Res combinations in 3T3 cells. In the resistant A549\u00a0cells, the combined administration of phytochemical enhanced cytotoxic effects. The combinations of Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Gin, Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Res, and Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Ber were identified as the most effective inhibitors in the PC-12\u00a0cell line. In HT-29\u00a0cells, the combinations of Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Gin, Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Res, Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Ber, and Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Res\u00a0+\u00a0Gin exhibited the highest inhibitory effects. Based on these findings, Cur was the most cytotoxic agent in monotherapy, while Cur\u00a0+\u00a0Res exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity in combination therapy. Moreover, combination therapy led to increased cytotoxic actions of phytochemicals in resistant cells. Therefore, combinational administration is recommended for future anti-cancer studies, as it allows for the use of lower concentrations of each phytochemical.",
