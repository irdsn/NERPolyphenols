  "abstract": "Although the association between PM2.5exposure and pulmonary fibrosis is well-documented, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood, and effective preventive strategies against PM2.5-induced pulmonary toxicity are yet to be established\u200c. This study investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated pseudo-hypoxia signaling and NF-\u03baB pathway activation in PM2.5-triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis, alongside the therapeutic potential of the antioxidant compound stilbene glucoside (TSG). \u200cIn vivo\u200c, C57BL/6 mice exposed to PM2.5for two months developed pulmonary fibrosis, with transcriptomic analysis revealing significant alterations in pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, cancer signaling, and immune-related diseases\u200c. Concurrently, upregulated expression of EMT markers (fibronectin, vimentin), glycolysis-related genes (PKM, LDHA), and inflammatory cytokines (TGF-beta) was observed in lung tissues\u200c. \u200cIn vitro\u200c, PM2.5induced EMT in BEAS-2B cells via ROS-driven mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, mitophagy, HIF-1\u03b1 activation, and NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammation, which collectively promoted a metabolic shift toward glycolysis\u200c. Notably, TSG treatment attenuated PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing ROS accumulation, pseudo-hypoxia signaling, and NF-\u03baB pathway activation. These effects correlated with restored mitochondrial function and normalized glucose metabolism in cellular models\u200c. \u200cWe come to the conclusion that PM2.5exacerbates pulmonary fibrosis through ROS/HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB axis-driven EMT and metabolic reprogramming. TSG, as a multifunctional antioxidant, represents a promising prophylactic agent against PM2.5-associated pulmonary damage\u200c.",
