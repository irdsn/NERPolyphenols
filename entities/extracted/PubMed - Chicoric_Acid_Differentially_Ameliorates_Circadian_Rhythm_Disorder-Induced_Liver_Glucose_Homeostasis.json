  "abstract": "Dietary phenolic compounds have demonstrated significant potential in preventing shift-work-induced metabolic dysregulation. Meanwhile, chrononutrition has revealed that the intake time of these compounds is closely related to human health. This study explored the effects and potential mechanism of the intervention time of chicoric acid on the improvement of glucose metabolism in a mouse model of the circadian rhythm disorder. Results showed that CA was effective in improving glucose tolerance and restoring the expression levels and phase shifts of clock genes (Bmal1,Per2,Cry2, etc.) and glucose metabolism-related genes (Gck,Pepck,G6pc). Further silencing ofBmal1in HepG2 cells revealed that CA can act as a biological clock regulator that regulates glucose metabolism-related genes in aBmal1-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that CA intervention at ZT12 optimally promoted glucose metabolic homeostasis, and the possible mechanism was that the intervention time coincided with the high expression ofBmal1.",
