  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the nutraceutical qualities of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples obtained from three Sicilian olivecultivars:Nocellara,Biancolilla, andCerasuola.We also evidenced the relationship among biophenols, base parameters and panel test scores, and evaluated the stability of the biophenols in EVOO. The assessment also took into consideration variations in olive harvesting periods and the influence of four different milling methods. A statistical analysis of the collected data revealed that the cultivar and harvesting period were the primary factors influencing the bio-phenol content, while the milling methods employed did not significantly affect the levels of biophenols in the oils. The panel test results were also illuminating as they were strongly related to the cultivar and polyphenol content. Following the criteria outlined in EC Regulation 432/2012, we selected three samples, each representing one of the cultivars, which exhibited the highest bio-phenol content to evaluate the biophenol stability during a time span of 16 months.",
