  "title": "Green Tea Catechins: A Promising Anticancer Approach for Leukaemia.",
  "abstract": "Green tea catechins are bioactive polyphenolic compounds that possess a number of biological activities and potential health benefits. This review will focus on discussing the effects of green tea catechins, with a particular emphasis on clinical studies that evaluate their anticancer potential. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), either as a stand-alone treatment or in conjunction with conventional anticancer therapies, represents a promising alternative strategy for the management of leukaemia. This review was based on a search of the scientific sources indexed in the databases PubMed and Scopus using the following keywords: 'Camellia sinensis', 'tea catechins', 'anticancer', 'antioxidant', 'hematological cancer', and 'leukaemia' in combination. A deeper comprehension of the multifaceted mechanisms and findings of research could facilitate the development of novel strategies and the integration of green tea catechins into clinical practice, thus enhancing treatment outcomes for patients with leukaemia.",
