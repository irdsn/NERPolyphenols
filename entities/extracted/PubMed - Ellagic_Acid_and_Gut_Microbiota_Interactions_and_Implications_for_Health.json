  "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA), a widely distributed natural polyphenolic acid existing in many kinds of plant-based foods, undergoes complex physical and chemical transformations during digestion and biotransformation. Particularly, EA is metabolized by gut microbiota and transformed into urolithins in the colon. These metabolites exhibit enhanced bioavailability and bioactivity. This review explores the intricate interactions between EA and gut microbiota, emphasizing their implications for human health. We discuss the role of gut microbiota in EA metabolism, resulting in distinct metabolic phenotypes associated with varying urolithin production profiles. EA and its gut-derived metabolites, urolithins, have been reported to have the potential to modulate the microbial community composition and function of gut microbiota, promoting beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful ones. Furthermore, EA and urolithins exhibit a spectrum of beneficial biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, along with enhancements to intestinal barrier function and modulatory effects on metabolic and cardiovascular systems, through molecular mechanisms such as activating Nrf2 and inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathways. The review highlights and compares the potential of EA and its gut microbial metabolites in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. However, further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the interactions between EA and gut microbiota and their health benefits. Continued investigation into EA and its metabolites is essential for advancing our understanding of their role in promoting human health and developing novel therapeutic applications.",
