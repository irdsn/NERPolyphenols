  "abstract": "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is one of the most common vegetable plants in the world. It is also named Lycopersicon esculentum. It serves as a model plant for the Solanaceae family, especially for plants that produce fleshy fruits. Various studies have shown that S. lycopersicum fruits, seeds, leaves, roots, in addition to tomato waste, constitute sources of vital bioactive substances such as lycopene, flavonoids, vitamins, and minerals. Consequently, tomatoes have powerful antioxidant activities in addition to cardiovascular protection, anticancer, antimutagenic, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, antidiabetic, radioprotective, gut modulating activities, vision effect, and hepatoprotective. The current review illuminates the different isolated phytochemicals and medicinal value, as well as the pharmacological activities of S. lycopersicum.",
