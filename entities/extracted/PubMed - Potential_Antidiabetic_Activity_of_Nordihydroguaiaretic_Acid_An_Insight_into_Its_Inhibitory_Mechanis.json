  "abstract": "The inhibitory mechanisms and binding behaviors of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) to \u03b1-glucosidase/\u03b1-amylase were investigated byin vitromultispectroscopic methods andin silicomodeling technique. The results demonstrated that NDGA reversibly and uncompetitively inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase, exhibiting stronger inhibition than acarbose, while it displayed noncompetitive inhibition against \u03b1-amylase. Additionally, NDGA could spontaneously bind to \u03b1-glucosidase/\u03b1-amylase mainly through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces, thus altering the spatial structure of enzymes and reducing their catalytic activity. The presence of crowding reagents/polysaccharides/undigested milk proteins would decrease the inhibitory ability of NDGA, whereas fatty acids exhibited the opposite phenomenon on \u03b1-glucosidase. Furthermore, the antidiabetic activity of NDGAin vivowas evaluated using the diabeticDrosophilamodel induced by a high-sugar diet. It was found that NDGA significantly reduced the glucose levels of diabeticDrosophila. These findings suggested that NDGA was a potential inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase/\u03b1-amylase and could be used as a nutritional adjuvant to prevent diabetes.",
