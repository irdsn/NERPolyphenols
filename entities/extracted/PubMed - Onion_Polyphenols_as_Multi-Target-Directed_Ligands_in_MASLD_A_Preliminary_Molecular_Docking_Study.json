  "abstract": "A sedentary lifestyle associated with unregulated diets rich in high-calorie foods have contributed to the great prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) latterly, with up to 60% in the high-risk population and 25% in the general population. The absence of specific pharmacological strategies for this syndrome represents one of the major problems in the management of MASLD patients. Lifestyle interventions and adherence to a healthy diet are the main cornerstones of current therapies. The identification of nutraceuticals useful in the treatment of MASLD appears to be one of the most promising strategies for the development of new effective and safe treatments for this disease. The onion, one of the most widely studied foods in the field of nutraceuticals, serves as an inexhaustible reservoir of potent compounds with various beneficial effects. The following preliminary study analyzes, mediating in silico studies, the iteration of a library of typical onion compounds with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, liver receptors X \u03b1 and \u03b2, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors \u03b1 and \u03b3. In this study, for the first time promising smart molecules from the onion that could have a beneficial action in MASLD patients were identified.",
