  "abstract": "Malocclusion can be corrected with orthodontic treatment to improve function and aesthetics. Orthodontic treatment patients have the potential to produce greater Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), as evidenced by an increase in the Oxidative Status Index (OSI) a week after treatment. As a result, oxidative stress may induce an imbalance of bone remodeling through intensifying osteoclastogenesis by expressing pro-inflammatory cytokine, namely Interleukin-6 (IL-6). The worst pathological condition that can occur is Orthodontic-Induced Root Resorption (OIRR), a resorptive area on the root that is unwanted from orthodontic treatment. OIRR incidence is reported to be more than 90\u00a0% asymptomatic. Using Forastero cacao bean (Theobroma cacaoL.) extract gel as a natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound is expected to be able to prevent excess ROS, which triggers an increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, which plays a role in the bone resorption pathway, thus reducing the incidence of OIRR and making orthodontic treatment successful through balanced bone remodeling.",
