  "abstract": "Propolis is a sticky, resinous material gather from plants and is blended with wax and other constituents. It is reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and blood glucose-lowering properties. This review aims to summarise evidences for the cellular and molecular mechanism of Propolis in inflammation, oxidative stress, and glycemic control. Propolis stimulate the production and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and due to its various antioxidant and poly-phenolic compounds may has a role in control and treating some of the chronic diseases. Most studies have shown that Propolis may affect metabolic factors including plasma insulin levels, and it has proposed that it could be used in the prevention and treatment of T2D Mellitus. In general, to demonstrate the definite effects of Propolis on chronic diseases, more studies are required using larger sample sizes and various doses of Propolis, using better characterized and standardized agents.",
