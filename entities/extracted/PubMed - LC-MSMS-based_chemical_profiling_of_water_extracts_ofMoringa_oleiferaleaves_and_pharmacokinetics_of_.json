  "abstract": "Moringa oleiferaleaves (MOL) are native to India and have high biological activities. To better understand the basic pharmacodynamic materials, the chemical components in MOL and their pharmacokinetic properties were studied and quantitated using UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS. Forty-two compounds were identified, including phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids, isothiocyanates, nucleosides, alkaloids, and other compounds. Two phenolic acids and six flavonoids were studied for their pharmacokinetic properties using UHPLC-MS/MS. Precision, accuracy, stability, matrix effects, and extraction recovery were verified. All substances that were measured reached their maximum within 0.5\u00a0h. Vicenin-2 had a high peak concentration and bioavailability. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside had a longer biological half-life than other components. The results from this study provide the data basis for subsequent comprehensive qualitative evaluation and potential MOL use in clinical applications.",
