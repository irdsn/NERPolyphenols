  "abstract": "Ultraviolet A (UVA), the major component of the UV, plays a crucial role in formatting the characteristics of color in wine grapes by influencing its anthocyanin composition and contents. Results showed that anthocyanin biosynthesis was suppressed by UVA screening and enhanced by irradiation. The acetylation andp-coumaroylation of anthocyanins were more pronounced and showed positive correlation with a* and negative correlation with L*, b*, C*, and h, thereby leading to changes in color. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that two modules (red and turquoise) were significantly related to the acetylation and p-coumaroylation of peonidin. In addition, relative gene expression assays and correlation analysis also indicated thatVvMYBA1might influence anthocyanin accumulation by directly regulatingVvOMTexpression and increasing the flux to the vacuole throughVvGST4. In conclusion, the results helped in improving our understanding of the role of UVA in skin color formation.",
