  "abstract": "Natural products have been a long-standing source for exploring health-beneficial components from time immemorial. Modern science has had a renewed interest in natural-products-based drug discovery. The quest for new potential secondary metabolites or exploring enhanced activities for existing molecules remains a pertinent topic for research. Resveratrol belongs to the stilbenoid polyphenols group that encompasses two phenol rings linked by ethylene bonds. Several plant species and foods, including grape skin and seeds, are the primary source of this compound. Resveratrol is known to possess potent anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and immunoregulatory properties. Among the notable bioactivities associated with resveratrol, its pivotal role in safeguarding the intestinal barrier is highlighted for its capacity to prevent intestinal inflammation and regulate the gut microbiome. A better understanding of how oxidative stress can be controlled using resveratrol and its capability to protect the intestinal barrier from a gut microbiome perspective can shed more light on associated physiological conditions. Additionally, resveratrol exhibits antitumor activity, proving its potential for cancer treatment and prevention. Moreover, cardioprotective, vasorelaxant, phytoestrogenic, and neuroprotective benefits have also been reported. The pharmaceutical industry continues to encounter difficulties administering resveratrol owing to its inadequate bioavailability and poor solubility, which must be addressed simultaneously. This report summarizes the currently available literature unveiling the pharmacological effects of resveratrol.",
