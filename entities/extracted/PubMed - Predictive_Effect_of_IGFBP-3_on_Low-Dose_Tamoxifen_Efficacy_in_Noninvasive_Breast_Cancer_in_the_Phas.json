  "title": "Predictive Effect of IGFBP-3 on Low-Dose Tamoxifen Efficacy in Noninvasive Breast Cancer in the Phase III Tam-01 Trial.",
  "abstract": "Low-dose tamoxifen 5 mg/day (babytam) for 3 years can decrease the incidence of new breast cancer events in women with breast intraepithelial neoplasia by 42% with limited toxicity, which provides a new treatment option for these disorders. However, predictive biomarkers of babytam efficacy are lacking. We studied whether baseline levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and their ratios predict babytam efficacy on breast cancer events in a preplanned secondary analysis.",
