  "abstract": "In this study, pectin (PE) composite films containing tea polyphenol (TP) and graphene oxide (GO) were developed. The effects of TP and GO on the appearance, structure, mechanical properties, barrier properties, hydrophobicity, and antioxidant properties of pure PE films were investigated. The results demonstrated that the addition of 1\u00a0%w/w TP and 1\u00a0% w/w GO increased the tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) of the composite films to 20.22\u00a0MPa and 34.18\u00a0%, respectively. Additionally, the water vapor permeability (WVP) was reduced to 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17 (\u00d710-10g-1s-1Pa-1), and both the moisture content and water contact angle were significantly decreased. Furthermore, the incorporation of TP enhanced the antioxidant properties of the composite films and demonstrated the slow-release capability of TP. Blueberry fruits packaged in PE-TP-GO film maintained an optimal appearance after eight days of storage at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, with a reduction in shrinkage index of approximately 29.4\u00a0% compared to those packaged in the PE film.",
