  "abstract": "The starch-polyphenol complex, identified as RS5-resistant starch, has been shown to regulate the gut environment and inhibit metabolic diseases, including obesity. In a study with C57BL/6 obese mice fed LSE, potential anti-obesity effects were demonstrated through physiological and biochemical assessments, gut microbiota analysis, and mechanistic insights. The study showed that LSE reduced mice body weight, serum total cholesterol, and triglycerides (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Serum inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and LPS levels were significantly decreased, while glucose tolerance (AUC reduced by 29.29\u00a0%) and insulin sensitivity (AUC reduced by 31.79\u00a0%) were improved. Histological analysis indicated reduction in adipocyte size and attenuation of hepatic steatosis. Gut microbiota profiling demonstrated LSE increased beneficial bacteria genera Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia. This correlated with enhanced SCFA production (acetate 41.53\u00a0%, propionate 45.52\u00a0%, butyrate 57.49\u00a0% increase). These findings demonstrate that LSE exerts anti-obesity effects through modulation of the gut microbiota-SCFA-metabolic axis, supporting starch-polyphenol complexes as functional food candidates.",
