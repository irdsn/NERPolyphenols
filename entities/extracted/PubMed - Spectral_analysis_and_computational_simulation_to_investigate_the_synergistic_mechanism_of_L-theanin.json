  "abstract": "Natural products are gaining attention as \u03b1-glucosidase (\u03b1-GLU) inhibitors owing to their safety and multifunctionality. L-theanine (THE) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in tea have inhibitory effects, but whether their synergistic inhibition of \u03b1-GLU remains unclear. This study investigated the synergistic mechanism of THE and EGCG in inhibiting \u03b1-GLU activity using spectral analysis and computational simulation. The results showed that a combination of 1.6\u00a0mM THE and 0.11\u00a0mM EGCG significantly enhanced \u03b1-GLU inhibition. Fluorescence quenching experiments revealed that EGCG did not alter the static quenching pattern of THE on \u03b1-GLU. However, it promoted enzyme conformational changes. Multi-spectral analysis and molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrated that THE and EGCG interacted non-covalently with key \u03b1-GLU residues (ASP-242, PHE-303, and PRO-312, etc.), disrupting the active site structure, reducing its catalytic efficiency. These findings provide valuable insight into the synergistic inhibition of \u03b1-GLU by natural active ingredients, with potential applications in functional foods.",
