  "title": "Picropodophyllin induces ferroptosis via blockage of AKT/NRF2/SLC7A11 and AKT/NRF2/SLC40A1 axes in hepatocellular carcinoma as a natural IGF1R inhibitor.",
  "abstract": "Ferroptosis represents a distinct form of regulated cell death characterized by intracellular iron overload and extensive lipid peroxidation. Targeting ferroptosis-related signaling pathways and inducing ferroptosis have emerged as promising therapeutic strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling in cancer progression and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Picropodophyllin (PPP), a natural IGF1R inhibitor isolated from Dysosma versipellis, exhibits anticancer effects against several solid tumors. However, the impact of PPP on ferroptosis in HCC and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.",
