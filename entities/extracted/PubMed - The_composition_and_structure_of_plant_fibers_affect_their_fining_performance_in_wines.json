  "abstract": "In recent years, the wine industry has shifted towards plant-based fining agents for food safety reasons and consumer preferences. This study analysed the interaction of five plant fibers with red wine phenolic compounds to determinate their performance as fining agents. Chemical composition, polysaccharide profile, and physical properties were examined. Pea, cellulose, and Sauvignon Blanc pomace fibers effectively reduced tannin content while minimally affecting the concentration of anthocyanins, flavonols and wine color. Contrary to previous beliefs, the presence of pectins in fibers didn't play a crucial role in phenolic compound interaction since cellulose-rich fibers with low pectin concentration also bound tannins effectively, especially those with small particle size and high contact surface. Pea fiber, rich in cellulose and pectins, showed remarkable tannin retention while minimally affecting wine color. This research highlights the potential of plant fibers as effective fining agents in wine production and how their composition affects their performance.",
