  "title": "Effects of Infrared Treatment on Some Constituents and Functional Properties of Chia Seed.",
  "abstract": "Infrared treatment has become increasingly popular in the food industry due to its advantages over conventional heating. The aim of this study is to enhance health beneficial components and functional properties of chia seeds by using infrared treatment at different powers (700, 900, 1100\u2009W) and times (25 and 50\u2009min). Infrared treatment caused a significant, gradual increase in the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of the chia samples. Total flavonoid and total dietary fiber content increased at 700 and 900\u2009W treatments. Chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid (except 1100\u2009W-50\u2009min treatment), rutin, and quercetin (only at 700\u2009W-50\u2009min & 900\u2009W-25\u2009min treatments) increased, whereas caffeic and p-coumaric acid decreased by infrared treatment. FTIR spectra for infrared treated samples have all specific peaks reported in the literature for chia. Slight changes were observed in peak intensities of infrared treated samples. Infrared treatment enhanced emulsion activity (up to 900\u2009W-25\u2009min) and stability (up to 700\u2009W-50\u2009min) but adversely affected the water and oil holding capacities. Infrared treatment of chia seeds enhanced the extractability of health beneficial constituents (e.g., phenolics and flavonoids) probably due to thermal breakdown of cellular components, and this may result in a health promoting effect. Utilization of infrared treated chia seeds as a raw material in value-added food products is promising.",
