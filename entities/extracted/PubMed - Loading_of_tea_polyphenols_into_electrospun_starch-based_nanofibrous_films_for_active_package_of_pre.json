  "abstract": "This study explores the development of environmentally friendly tea polyphenol (TP)-loaded natural polysaccharide-based nanofibrous films (FFs) using green electrospinning techniques for active packaging of pre-processed fish fillets. Three types of TPs were incorporated into an aqueous octenylsuccinylated starch (OSS)/pullulan (PUL) dispersion to produce TP/OSS/PUL-FFs, whose structural characteristics (appearance, chromaticity, and fiber morphology) and functional properties (antioxidant capacity, antibacterial activity, thermal stability, and water contact properties) were comprehensively evaluated. Among the FFs, TP3/OSS/PUL-FF exhibited the best performance, including the highest thermal degradation temperature (302.04\u00a0\u00b0C), the lowest water contact angle (17.85\u00b0), and the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial properties, attributed to its high epigallocatechin gallate content (59.13 %). When applied to pre-processed fish fillets during an 8-day storage period at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the TP3/OSS/PUL-FF active packaging significantly reduced spoilage indicators, including total colony count, pH fluctuation, total volatile basic nitrogen, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, outperforming control groups. These findings highlight the potential of TP3/OSS/PUL-FF as an effective and sustainable active packaging material for extending the shelf life of pre-processed meat products.",
