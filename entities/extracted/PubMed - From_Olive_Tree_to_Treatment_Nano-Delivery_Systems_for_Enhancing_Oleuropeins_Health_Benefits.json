  "title": "From Olive Tree to Treatment: Nano-Delivery Systems for Enhancing Oleuropein's Health Benefits.",
  "abstract": "Oleuropein is a natural polyphenolic compound isolated from olive trees (Olea europaea). Besides the strong antioxidant effect of oleuropein, it has many pharmacological activities such as anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and many other activities. Thus, oleuropein could be used alone or with other drugs to prevent and treat many diseases. Despite its promising health benefits, oleuropein is highly prone to hydrolysis inside and outside the human body, in addition to a poorly identified pharmacokinetic profile and poor bioavailability. Many nanocarrier delivery systems have overcome the delivery limitations of oleuropein in order to maximize its therapeutic benefits. Therefore, this review article sheds light on nano-delivery systems explored until the current date, aiming to enhance oleuropein's bioavailability and therapeutic impact by improving its pharmacokinetic properties and addressing its stability challenges. Continued research into innovative nanotechnology solutions will be crucial in unlocking the full potential of oleuropein as a powerful nutraceutical and pharmaceutical agent.",
