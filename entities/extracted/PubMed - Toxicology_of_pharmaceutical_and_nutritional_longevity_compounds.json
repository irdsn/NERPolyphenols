  "abstract": "Aging is the most prominent risk factor for many diseases, which is considered to be a complicated biological process. The rate of aging depends on the effectiveness of important mechanisms such as the protection of DNA from free radicals, which protects the structural and functional integrity of cells and tissues. In any organism, not all organs may age at the same rate. Slowing down primary aging and reaching maximum lifespan is the most basic necessity. In this process, it may be possible to slow down or stabilise some diseases by using the compounds for both dietary and pharmacological purposes. Natural compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, mostly plant-based nutraceuticals, are preferred in the treatment of age-related chronic diseases and can also be used for other diseases. An increasing number of long-term studies on synthetic and natural compounds aim to elucidate preclinically and clinically the mechanisms underlying being healthy and prolongation of life. To delay age-related diseases and prolong the lifespan, it is necessary to take these compounds with diet or pharmaceuticals, along with detailed toxicological results. In this review, the most promising and utilised compounds will be highlighted and it will be discussed whether they have toxic effects in short/long-term use, although they are thought to be used safely.",
