  "abstract": "pH-responsive intelligent films for food freshness monitoring have attracted great attentions recently. In this study, several intelligent films based on chitosan (CS), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and grape skin anthocyanin (GSA) were prepared, and the effect of film-forming solution pH on the properties of intelligent films was investigated. The results of SEM, FTIR, XRD and TGA displayed that the hydrogen bond between CS and GSA was strong at strong acidic conditions (2.0-2.5), and it weakened at weak acidic conditions (3.0-4.5). Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond between PVA and GSA was negligible under strong acidic conditions, and it appeared under weak acidic conditions. Consequently, the films fabricated under weak acidic conditions displayed lower water solubility, lower water vapor permeability, and higher elongation at break. The tensile strength of films increased firstly and subsequently decreased with pH increasing, reaching a maximum value of 31.44\u00a0MPa at pH\u00a03.5. Additionally, the films prepared at pH\u00a02.5 and 4.0 showed the best color responsiveness to ammonia and acetic acid, respectively. Overall, the intelligent films prepared under variant pH have the potential to realize the goal of monitoring the freshness of different types of food, thereby expanding the application subject of anthocyanins-based intelligent films.",
