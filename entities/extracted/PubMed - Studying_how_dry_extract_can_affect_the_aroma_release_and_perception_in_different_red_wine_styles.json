  "abstract": "Four red wine matrices representing different red wine styles with the same VOCs (volatile organic compounds), were obtained by enriching a bleed wine with increasing amounts of deodorized dry extract obtained from the pressed wine of the same vinification. The release of VOCs was determined by solid phase micro-extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS), in conditions mimicking those applied during sensory assessments.",
