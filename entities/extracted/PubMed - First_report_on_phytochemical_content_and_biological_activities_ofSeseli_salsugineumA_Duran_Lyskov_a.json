  "abstract": "Five pyranocoumarins (1-5) together with a simple coumarin, umbelliferone (6), have been isolated fromSeseli salsugineumA. Duran & Lyskov, a newly described endemic species for T\u00fcrkiye, and their structural elucidation was performed by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with the literature data. In addition, hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), and methanol (MeOH) extracts were examined for their antioxidant and enzyme inhibition potentials. The current study is the first report on an endemicS.salsugineum, regarding interesting bioactive coumarins (pyranocoumarins and a simple coumarin) and the extract's biological properties. Further research is needed to isolate new compounds from this plant and uncover its potential uses as a health-promoting and healing agent.",
