  "title": "Hop (Humulus lupulusL.) Phenolic Compounds Profile Depends on Cultivar and Plant Organ Maturity.",
  "abstract": "Hop by-products constitute a significant part of biomass in cones production for the brewing industry. The phenolic compounds (PCs) they contain can be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries but require qualitative and quantitative analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which phenolic compounds profiles depend on cultivar, plant organ, and plant level. This paper shows for the first time that for hop, it is not only the plant organ that is important for PC content, but also the level from which it is obtained. Metabolites were investigated in cones, leaves, and stalks at three levels of the plant in Polish hop cultivars (Marynka, Lubelski, and Magnum). The PC content showed a differentiation due to the cultivar of hops, their anatomical part, and position in the plant (level), which reflects the degree of organ maturity. The total PC was the highest in leaves (up to 922 mg/100 g), while lower contents were found in cones (up to 421 mg/100 g) and stalks (up to 105 mg/100 g). The main PCs of leaves were kaempferol-3-glucoside (up to 328 mg/100 g) and rutin (up to 293 mg/100 g), while rutin dominated in cones (up to 209 mg/100 g).",
