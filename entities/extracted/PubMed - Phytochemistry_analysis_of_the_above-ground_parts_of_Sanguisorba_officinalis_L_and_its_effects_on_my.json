  "abstract": "Sanguisorba officinalis L. (S. officinalis) has been shown to alleviate inflammation, lipid metabolism and glycolysis, yet the constituents of the above-ground parts of S. officinalis and its effects on these abnormal metabolic processes is still unclear. In this paper, the constituents of the above-ground parts of S. officinalis was identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, and its effects on metabolism was evaluated in isoproterenol-treated H9C2 cell and C57BL/6 mice. Results revealed that 69 ingredients was determined in the above-ground parts of S. officinalis, including 13 flavonoids and their glycosides, 36 phenolic acids and their glycosides, 13 sapogenins and their glycosides, and 7 other types of compounds. Meanwhile, results also revealed that the above-ground parts of S. officinalis could inhibit the accumulation of lipids via HIF-1\u03b1/HSP70 pathway, decrease the over-activation of glycolysis via HKII and PFKFB3, and decrease the over-activation of inflammation via NF-\u03baB p65 and iNOS in vitro. Moreover, the similar results were determined in vivo, and the effects of the above-ground parts of S. officinalis on the expressions of related proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Consequently, the above-ground parts of S. officinalis could effectively improve metabolic abnormalities in myocardial infarction model, and it could be serve as a potential drug for preventing and treating myocardial infarction.",
