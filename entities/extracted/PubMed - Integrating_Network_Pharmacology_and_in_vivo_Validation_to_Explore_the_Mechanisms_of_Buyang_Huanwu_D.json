  "abstract": "Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has been widely used to manage cardiovascular disorders. However, its cardioprotective mechanisms in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) remain unclear. This study aims to investigate its pharmacological mechanisms against MI/RI through network pharmacology and experimental validation.",
