  "abstract": "Male pattern hair loss (MPHL), also known as androgenetic alopecia (AGA), is a common disorder primarily caused by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two 5-alpha reductase (5-AR) inhibitors-finasteride and dutasteride-for treating this condition. However, recent studies have reported adverse sexual side effects and issues with sperm production in young men using these medications. There are also recommendations for effectively treating hair loss with natural remedies, such asUrtica dioica (nettle),Serenoa repens (saw palmetto), andTrigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek)that is mainly used for diminish the hair loss in the traditional medicine. Research shows that these herbal formulations and plant extracts may help reduce hair loss. However, the concentration of active compounds in these herbal extracts is often low, necessitating a large extract volume to achieve noticeable effects on hair growth. Although many studies have investigated the effects of these herbal extracts on hair growth, fewer studies focus on the specific compounds influencing the molecular mechanisms of hair loss, particularly the inhibition of 5-AR.",
