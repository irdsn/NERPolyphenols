  "abstract": "Good nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. The beneficial effects of nutrition have been found to counteract nutritional disturbances with the expanded use of nutraceuticals to treat and manage cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other developmental defects over the last decade. Flavonoids are found abundantly in plant-derived foods such as fruits, vegetables, tea, cocoa, and wine. Fruits and vegetables contain phytochemicals like flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, saponins, and terpenoids. Flavonoids can act as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-microbial (antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral) antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-diarrheal agents. Flavonoids are also reported to upregulate apoptotic activity in several cancers such as hepatic, pancreatic, breast, esophageal, and colon. Myricetin is a flavonol which is naturally present in fruits and vegetables and has shown possible nutraceutical value. Myricetin has been portrayed as a potent nutraceutical that may protect against cancer. The focus of the present review is to present an updated account of studies demonstrating the anticancer potential of myricetin and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying its anticancer activity would eventually help in its development as a novel anticancer nutraceutical having minimal side effects.",
