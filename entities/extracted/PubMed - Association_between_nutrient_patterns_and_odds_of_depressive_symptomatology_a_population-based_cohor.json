  "title": "Association between nutrient patterns and odds of depressive symptomatology: a population-based cohort of older adults followed during 15-y.",
  "abstract": "Nutrition, as a modifiable exposure, seems relevant to prevent depression. Several nutrients have been associated with a lower risk of depression in older adults, but longitudinal studies examining nutrient combinations are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the association between a posteriori nutrient patterns and the odds of depressive symptomatology (DS) in older adults over time.",
