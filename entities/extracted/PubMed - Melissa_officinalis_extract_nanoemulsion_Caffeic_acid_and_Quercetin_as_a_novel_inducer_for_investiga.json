  "abstract": "Cell therapy utilizing mesenchymal stem cells, which have the ability to differentiate into different lineages, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Melissa officinalis is rich in biologically active compounds and exhibits antioxidant activity, antimicrobial properties, and sedative effects. Nanoemulsions can facilitate the effective transfer of substances and also protect drugs and biological materials from environmental factors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of Melissa officinalis extract nanoemulsion and the active ingredients of caffeic acid and quercetin as inducers in increasing the efficiency of differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into neural cells in a laboratory environment.",
