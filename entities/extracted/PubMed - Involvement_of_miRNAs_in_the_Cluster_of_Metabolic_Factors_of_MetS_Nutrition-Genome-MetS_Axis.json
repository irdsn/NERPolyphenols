  "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression and play essential roles in physiological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism. They have emerged as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). In recent years, exosome-derived miRNAs, known as \"xeno-miRNAs\", which are derived from food, as well as circulating miRNAs, have emerged as areas of intense research due to their potential effects on metabolic disorders. miRNAs influence fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance through mechanisms such as \u03b2-cell differentiation, insulin gene transcription, and PI3K-AKT pathway activation. Additionally, miRNAs play important roles in regulating MetS components, as follows: obesity through adipogenesis and lipogenesis; hypertension through regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vascular tone; and dyslipidemia by modulating lipid metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests that nutrients such as polyphenols and specific dietary patterns can alter miRNA expression, potentially impacting metabolic health. Understanding the interactions between diet and miRNA regulation offers novel insights into the prevention and treatment of MetS. This review explores the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence MetS components, and highlights the growing potential of nutrient-regulated miRNAs as therapeutic targets within the framework of precision nutrition and personalized metabolic disease management.",
