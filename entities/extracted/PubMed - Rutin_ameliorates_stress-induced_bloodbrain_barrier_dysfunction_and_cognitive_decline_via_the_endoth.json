  "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress compromises blood\u2012brain barrier (BBB) integrity by disrupting brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), contributing to the development of cognitive impairments. Thus, targeting the BBB is expected to be a promising treatment strategy. The biological function of rutin has been investigated in neurological disorders; however, its regulatory role in stress-induced BBB damage and cognitive decline and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.",
