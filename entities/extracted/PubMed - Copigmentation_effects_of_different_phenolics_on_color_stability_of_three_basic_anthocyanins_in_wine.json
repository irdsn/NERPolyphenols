  "abstract": "The effects of six polyphenol copigments on color stability of three monomeric anthocyanins was investigated during wine aging (90\u00a0days) through the analysis of chromaticity, thermodynamics and molecular dynamics simulation. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside and caffeic acid exhibited a more pronounced copigmentation effect, with the copigmentation effects of all polyphenol copigments on malvidin-3-O-glucoside and malvidin-3-O-acetylglucoside being significantly greater than that on delphinidin-3-glucoside. The thermodynamic parameters also showed that both the structures of anthocyanins and copigments could influence copigmentation effects, and the quercetin obtained the strongest copigment with malvidin-3-O-glucoside (K\u00a0=\u00a01572.01). Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces facilitated the interaction between anthocyanins and flavonol. The hydroxylated groups of delphinidin-3-glucoside might alter the spatial conformation of the complex, resulting in steric effect. The findings of this study could contribute to a deeper understanding of how copigments and anthocyanin structures influence color stability during wine storage.",
