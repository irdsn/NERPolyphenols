  "abstract": "Human milk (HM) contains a multitude of nutritive and nonnutritive bioactive compounds that support infant growth, immunity and development, yet its complex composition remains poorly understood. Integrating diverse scientific disciplines from nutrition and global health to data science, the International Milk Composition (IMiC) Consortium was established to undertake a comprehensive harmonized analysis of HM from low, middle and high-resource settings to inform novel strategies for supporting maternal-child nutrition and health.",
