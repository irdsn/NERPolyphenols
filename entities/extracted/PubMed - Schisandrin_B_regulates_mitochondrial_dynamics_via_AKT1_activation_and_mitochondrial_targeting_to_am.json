  "abstract": "Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI) is a significant cause of acute kidney injury(AKI) and delayed graft function(DGF), impacting post-transplant outcomes. Mitochondrial dynamics, in particular fission and fusion, play a pivotal role in the cellular response to RIRI. The modulation of these dynamics represents a potential therapeutic target. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a component derived from traditional Chinese medicine, has shown protective roles in various organ injuries, but its effect on RIRI through mitochondrial dynamics remains unexplored.",
