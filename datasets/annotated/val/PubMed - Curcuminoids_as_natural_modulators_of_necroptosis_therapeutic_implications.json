  "abstract": "Necroptosis is an emerging form of programmed cell death characterized by necrosis, an inflammatory type of cell death. Necroptosis is primarily initiated by specific mediators that interact with receptor proteins, leading to the activation of protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3. These kinases transmit death signals and recruit and phosphorylate mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), which ultimately triggers cell death and necroptosis. Curcuminoids, natural compounds derived from turmeric, have been shown to possess various therapeutic benefits, including neuroprotective, anti-metabolic syndrome, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. In this concise overview, we aim to explore the relationship between curcuminoids and the molecular mechanisms of the necroptosis pathway based on recent in vivo and in vitro studies. The available literature indicates that curcuminoids, mainly curcumin, can act as inhibitors of necroptosis in tissue damage scenarios while serving as a necroptosis inducer in cancer cells. Curcuminoids significantly influence key indicators of necroptosis, highlighting their potential to enhance disease treatment. Future studies should focus on further investigating this important component of turmeric to advance therapeutic approaches.",
