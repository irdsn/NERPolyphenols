  "title": "Effects of polyphenols on physicochemical and digestive properties of Trichosanthes kirilowii starch.",
  "abstract": "As a natural functional ingredient, Trichosanthes kirilowii (TK) starch is widely used in the fields of food and medicine, but its physicochemical stability and digestive properties still need to be optimized to enhance its application potential. Polyphenolic substances (such as ferulic acid, caffeic acid, etc.) have attracted much attention because of their ability to improve food functional properties and regulate digestion and metabolism. The present study focused on the co gelation of polyphenols and TK starch, aiming to systematically reveal the regulation mechanism of five polyphenols (ferulic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, gallic acid and quercetin) on the physicochemical properties and digestion behavior of starch, and also provide a theoretical basis for the development of functional starch based composites.",
