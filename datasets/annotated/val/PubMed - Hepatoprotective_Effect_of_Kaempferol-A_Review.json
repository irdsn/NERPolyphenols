  "abstract": "Liver diseases, including chronic inflammation and related metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), fibrosis and cirrhosis remain a growing global health burden. Currently, available pharmacotherapy for liver dysfunction has limited efficacy. Kaempferol, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has demonstrated significant hepatoprotective effects in preclinical models. This substance activates the SIRT1/AMPK signalling pathway, improves mitochondrial function, inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production via TLR4/NF-\u03baB suppression and attenuates hepatic stellate cell activation by modulating the TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway. In addition, kaempferol regulates the composition of the gut microbiota, thus improving bile acid metabolism and alleviating steatosis and fibrosis. This review presents an integrated analysis of recent in vitro and in vivo studies on the mode of action and utility of kaempferol in liver disease and hepatoprotection.",
