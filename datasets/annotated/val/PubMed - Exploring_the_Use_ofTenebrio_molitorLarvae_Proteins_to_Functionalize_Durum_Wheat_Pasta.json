  "abstract": "Edible insects, such asTenebrio molitorlarvae (TM), offer a sustainable protein alternative to meet increasing dietary demands. The aim of this study is to investigate the functionalization of durum wheat pasta through the incorporation of TM flour (0-30%), focusing on how the addition of this non-conventional ingredient affects pasta production processing and its technological and chemical characteristics.",
