  "abstract": "The genusClinopodiumL. (Lamiaceae) comprises perennial herbaceous plants known for their diverse pharmacological properties. Clinically, these plants are mainly used for the treatment of various hemorrhagic disorders. This review systematically summarizes the research progress on the chemical composition, pharmacological activity, quality control, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of the genusClinopodiumby searching Google Scholar, Scopus-Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Medline, Web of Science, CNKI, Weipu, Wanfang, and other academic databases over the last decade (March 2015-February 2025). To date, more than one hundred and thirty structurally diverse secondary metabolites have been isolated and identified from this genus, including flavonoids, triterpenoid saponins, diterpenoid glycosides, lignans, and phenylpropanoids. In addition, numerous volatile oil constituents have been identified in over forty species of the genusClinopodium. Crude extracts and purified compounds exhibit a variety of pharmacological activities, including hemostatic, anti-myocardial cell injury, cardiovascular protective, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor, hypoglycemic, and insecticidal properties. However, current quality assessment protocols in the genusClinopodiumare limited to flavonoid- and saponin-based evaluations inC. chinense(Benth.) O. Kuntze andC. gracile(Benth.) O. Matsum. Further research is needed to elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms, toxicity, and possible interactions with other drugs. Therefore, the genusClinopodiumhas a wide range of biologically active compounds with potential applications in drug development for hemostasis and cardiovascular protection. Nevertheless, there is also an urgent need to establish standardized methodologies to address uncertainties concerning the safety and efficacy of injectable extracts or compounds.",
