  "abstract": "Osteosarcoma, a primary malignant bone tumor, is challenging to treat due to its aggressive nature and limited therapies. Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenol, has potential anticancer properties. Hence, we investigated RES's impact on osteosarcoma cells, focusing on triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and related mechanisms.",
