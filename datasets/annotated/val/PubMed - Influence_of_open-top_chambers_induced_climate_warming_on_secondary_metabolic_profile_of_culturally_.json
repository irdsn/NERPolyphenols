  "abstract": "Plants native to colder climates, higher elevations, or semi-arid regions have more phenolic compounds in their organs. Faced with the current climate crisis, the effects of global heating with overgrazing pressure on natural pastures are not fully recognized in the Himalaya-Karakoram and Hindukush (HKH) region. The objective of this research was to investigate how biological active compound accumulation and concentration of high-elevation plants change under the influence of simulated climate warming which was induced by open-top chambers. The bioactive profiling plant species from experimental units were investigated through High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and compared with control. That revealed a significant increase in the major phenolic acid and flavonoid compounds (Rutin, Quercetin, Myricetin, Gallic Acid, and Kaempferol). The accumulation of other minor compounds, such as Vanillic Acid, Syringic Acid, Ferulic Acid, and Catechin, showed species-specific variation in concentration. The species-specific responses indicated the dominant and positive adaptation species such as P. macrophylla, A. rupestris, A. penduncularis, P. hololeuca, P. alpina, and under stress could accumulate more secondary metabolites, explaining their capacity for adaptation. These species' proliferation under a stressed climate and higher elevation with grazing pressure provides insightful information about their exploitation of phenolic compounds which may alter the environmental sustainability.",
