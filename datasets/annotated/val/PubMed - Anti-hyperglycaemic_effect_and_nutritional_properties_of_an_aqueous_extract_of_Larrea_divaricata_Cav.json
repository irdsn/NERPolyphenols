(Zygophyllaceae) (jarilla) is a native plant of South America widely distributed across Argentina and used in popular medicine to treat diabetes and hypercholesterolemia by the Diaguita-Calchaqu\u00ed, Amaichas, and Quilmes indigenous communities and by non-indigenous population (criollos) of Calamuchita, in the province of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.
