  "abstract": "Cardiac aging is accompanied by changes in the heart at the cellular and molecular levels, leading to alterations in cardiac structure and function. Given today's increasingly aging population, the decline in cardiac function caused by cardiac aging has a significant impact on quality of life. Antiaging therapies to slow the aging process and attenuate changes in cardiac structure and function have become an important research topic. Treatment with drugs, including metformin, spermidine, rapamycin, resveratrol, astaxanthin, Huolisu oral liquid, and sulforaphane, has been demonstrated be effective in delaying cardiac aging by stimulating autophagy, delaying ventricular remodeling, and reducing oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. Furthermore, caloric restriction has been shown to play an important role in delaying aging of the heart. Many studies in cardiac aging and cardiac aging-related models have demonstrated that Sestrin2 has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, stimulates autophagy, delays aging, regulates mitochondrial function, and inhibits myocardial remodeling by regulation of relevant signaling pathways. Therefore, Sestrin2 is likely to become an important target for antimyocardial aging therapy.",
