  "abstract": "Soybean meal (SBM), widely used in pig farming, can induce intestinal damage and dysfunction in newly-weaned piglets due to the presence of soybean antigen proteins. However, research on natural compounds capable of mitigating these adverse effects remains limited. This study investigated the effects of lycopene, a carotenoid, on the intestinal health of piglets fed a SBM-based diet.",
