  "abstract": "The rapid emergence of resistant fungi is occurring worldwide, and this crisis has been attributed to the lack of new antifungal drug development. This issue emphasizes the need for innovation in finding novel antifungals. There is an increasing interest in using the natural products of plants with high biological activity as alternatives to synthetic drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the possible applicability of polyphenols as alternative antifungal drugs to treat resistantCandidainfections.",
