  "abstract": "Coffea arabicahas garnered significant attention for its potential therapeutic applications due to its rich phytochemical profile, including chlorogenic acids, flavonoids, and alkaloids like caffeine, which are associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the phytochemical composition of an ethanolic extract derived from green seeds ofCoffea arabicaand (ii) perform a preliminaryin ovoscreening to determine its mucosal tolerability, irritant potential, and pro-angiogenic activity using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model.",
