  "abstract": "Olive oil (OO) has longstanding significance in human history, particularly in the Mediterranean region, where it has been a cornerstone of diet, economy, and culture. This history adds to modern evidence-based knowledge.Background: The Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in plant-based foods and OO, has been extensively associated with improved cardiometabolic and cognitive health. Recent interest has emerged in understanding how intermittent fasting protocols may enhance these effects. Still, the quality of OO does not only lie in the extraction process; it is also dependent on the tree variety, the soil, and the agricultural practices, ending with the way in which the finished product is stored and consumed.Objectives: This review explores the synergistic potential between OO consumption and intermittent fasting, focusing on their combined impact on metabolic health, oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways.Methods: A literature search was conducted using multiple databases to identify studies addressing the health effects of OO, fasting, and the MD. Both human and relevant preclinical studies were considered, with emphasis on those evaluating inflammatory markers, lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and neuroprotective mechanisms.Results: Evidence suggests that the bioactive compounds in EVOO may potentiate the benefits of fasting by enhancing antioxidant capacity, reducing postprandial inflammation, and modulating gene expression related to cellular metabolism. Combined, these factors may support improved insulin sensitivity, reduced oxidative damage, and delayed onset of age-related diseases.Conclusions: Understanding the integrative role of OO and fasting within the MD framework could offer valuable insights for nutritional strategies aimed at preventing metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration. These findings also support the need for future clinical trials exploring the timing, dosage, and dietary context in which these interventions are most effective.",
