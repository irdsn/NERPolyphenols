  "abstract": "In wine production, technology influences its chemical composition, which in turn affects its organoleptic properties. As a result, innovative production techniques play a crucial role on the competitive wine market. Underwater wine aging has gained increasing popularity in recent years as an innovative method that can expand the variety of products available and bring engaging story telling. Some companies now offer this service to wine producers, although there is still limited knowledge about its effects on different wine types. This preliminary study investigated the impact of underwater aging by examining a well-structured red wine that was submerged for several months in spring water, comparing them to the same wine aged in a cellar for the same period. The chemical properties of the wines were analyzed after both the first (12 months of underwater and cellar aging), second (another 12 months), and third aging periods (further 12 months), to determine if there were any significant differences between them. The results revealed that underwater aging had a significant impact on the wines' chemical composition. The dissolved oxygen level and total anthocyanin content were most notably affected by the different aging methods, while the phenolic profile and color compounds showed less influence from the treatments. The sensory test indicated that the wines aged under water and in the cellar were perceived differently, depending on the aging method and the time of evaluation (after 12, 24 or 36 months). The results of the organoleptic tests underline how the effect of the conservation environment on the sensory properties is of greater impact in the early stages of post-bottling refinement, while the differences tend to disappear when the post-bottling refinement is extended up to 36 months. The first results of a second experimental campaign seem to confirm the trends detected in the first one, although with less evidence. Further investigation is required to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of underwater aging and its wider impact on wine production.",
