  "abstract": "One approach to controlling type 2 diabetes (T2D) is to lower postprandialglucose spikesby slowing down the digestion of carbohydrates and the absorption of glucose in the small intestine. The consumption of walnuts is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as T2D, suggested to be partly due to the high content of (poly)phenols. This study evaluated, for the first time, the inhibitory effect of a (poly)phenol-rich walnut extract on human carbohydrate digesting enzymes (salivary and pancreatic \u03b1-amylases, brush border sucrase-isomaltase) and on glucose transport across fully differentiated human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 monolayers. The walnut extract was rich in multiple (poly)phenols (70\u00a0% w/w) as analysed by Folin-Ciocalteau and by LCMS. It exhibited potent inhibition of both human salivary (IC50: 32.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5g walnut (poly)phenols (WP)/mL) and pancreatic (IC50: 56.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00b5g WP/mL) \u03b1-amylases, with weaker effects on human sucrase (IC50: 990\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0\u00b5g WP/mL), maltase (IC50: 1300\u00a0\u00b1\u00a080\u00a0\u00b5g WP/mL), and isomaltase (IC25: 830\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0\u00b5g WP/mL) activities. Selected individual walnut (poly)phenols inhibited human salivary \u03b1-amylase in the order: 1,3,4,6-tetragalloylglucose\u00a0>\u00a0ellagic acid pentoside\u00a0>\u00a01,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranose, with no inhibition by ellagic acid, gallic acid and 4-O-methylgallic acid. The (poly)phenol-rich walnut extract also attenuated (up to 59\u00a0%) the transfer of 2-deoxy-D-glucose across differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cell monolayers. This is the first report on the effect of (poly)phenol-rich extracts from any commonly-consumed nut kernel on any human starch-digesting enzyme, and suggests a mechanism through which walnut consumption may lower postprandial glucose spikes and contribute to their proposed health benefits.",
