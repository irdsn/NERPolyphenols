  "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural phenol that is present in the skin of the grape, blueberry, raspberry, mulberry, and peanut. This substance is synthesized in these plants following injury or exposure to pathogens. Resveratrol is used as a dietary supplement for a long time and its effects have been assessed in animal models of human disorders. It has potential beneficial effects in diverse pathological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, neoplastic conditions, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disorders. Notably, resveratrol has been found to affect the expression of several genes including cytokine coding genes, caspases, matrix metalloproteinases, adhesion molecules, and growth factors. Moreover, it can modulate the activity of several signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, Wnt, NF-\u03baB, and Notch pathways. In the current review, we summarize the results of studies that reported modulatory effects of resveratrol on the expression of genes and the activity of signaling pathways. We explain these results in two distinct sections of non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions.",
