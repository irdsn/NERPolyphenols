  "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common and frequently devastating disorder affecting millions of people. According to a recent survey, 1-2% of the Indian population suffers from major mental disorders and 5% suffers from minor mental disorders. Epilepsy is among those mental disorders that affect 30 million people worldwide. Currently, the treatment of epilepsy involves agents which modulate sodium-ion channels, enhance GABAergic transmission, and agents with multiple modes of action. Various classes of synthetic drugs are used to treat epilepsy, but these drugs are often challenged due to their unwanted side effects.
