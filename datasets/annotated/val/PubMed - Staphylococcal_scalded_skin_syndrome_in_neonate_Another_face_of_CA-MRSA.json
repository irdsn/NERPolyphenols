  "abstract": "Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), also known as Ritter's disease, in its severe form occurs predominantly in infants and children. It is caused by infection with group II (often phage group 71) Staphylococcus aureus . The foci of infection include nasopharynx, less commonly umbilicus, urinary tract, superficial abrasion, conjunctivae, and blood. Staphylococci are non-motile, non-spore-forming, catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that appear predominantly as grape-like clusters. Although this organism is frequently a part of normal human microbial flora, it can cause significant opportunistic infections under certain conditions such as when extremes of age groups are involved, the presence of indwelling medical devices, and intravenous (iv) drug abuse. Staphylococcus aureus may cause a variety of infectious manifestations ranging from relatively benign skin infections to life-threatening systemic illnesses. SSSS caused by S. aureus strains produces exfoliative toxins which result in the development of blisters, erythema, and desquamation. Here, we present a case of an 11-day-old neonate who was diagnosed with SSSS. The causative agent responsible for this syndrome was identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The molecular characterization of the gene Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was detected positive for PVL which is a distinctive virulence factor seen almost in all of the community-acquired MRSA strains. The patient was discharged after parenteral clindamycin therapy with almost complete resolution of symptoms.",
