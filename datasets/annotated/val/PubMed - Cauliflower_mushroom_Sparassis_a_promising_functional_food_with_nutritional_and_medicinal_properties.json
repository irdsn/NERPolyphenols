  "abstract": "Sparassisspp., commonly known as the cauliflower mushroom, is widely appreciated and consumed across numerous countries. It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its unique morphological characteristics, rich nutritional value, and pharmacological effects. In spite of the high demand for cauliflower mushrooms and their increasing economic importance, their cultivation is limited.Sparassismushrooms are rich in macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and unsaturated fatty acids) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Notably,Sparassisspp. exhibits exceptionally high\u03b2-glucan content (up to 43.6% dry weight), contributing to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-tumor activities. Polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, and lectins derived from these mushrooms demonstrate therapeutic potential against chronic diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cancer through mechanisms involving immune activation, oxidative stress reduction, and gut microbiota modulation. This comprehensive review explores the taxonomy, artificial cultivation, nutritional value, medicinal properties, and nutraceutical applications ofSparassisspp., focusing on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in the research and utilization of this remarkable fungal genus. The findings highlight the potential ofSparassisas a promising source of bioactive compounds with significant implications for food science and nutraceutical applications.",
