  "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of hydromethanolic (Lepidium sativumLinn) seeds extract in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was induced by carrageenan and treated after byL sativum. The high pressure liquid chromatography-diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis of theL. sativumpolyphenols extract revealed the presence of gallic acid, syringic acid, hydroxycinnamic and flavonoid compounds (rutin, apigenin). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging method showed an appreciable antioxidant activity ofL sativumextract (0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005\u2009\u00b5g/mL) compared to the ascorbic acid (0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005\u2009\u00b5g/mL). Oral administration ofL. sativumextract reduced significantly the carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in mice after 2\u2009h (24.96\u2009\u00b1\u20098.48% and 14.17\u2009\u00b1\u20096.12% at doses of 150 and 300\u2009mg/kg BW respectively) compared to diclofenac (23.66\u2009\u00b1\u200910.69 at 50\u2009mg/kg). These results confirmed by the histological study suggest thatL. sativummay be useful therapeutic drug for treating inflammation.",
