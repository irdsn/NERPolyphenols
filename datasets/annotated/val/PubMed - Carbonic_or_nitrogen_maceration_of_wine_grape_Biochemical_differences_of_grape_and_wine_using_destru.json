  "abstract": "As an alternative to traditional carbonic maceration (CM), this study explores the use of nitrogen maceration (NM) to create anoxic conditions during winemaking in Vitis vinifera cv. Gamay teinturier. A combination of destructive (HPLC, GC-MS, metabolomics) and non-destructive (NIR-AOTF, metallo-porphyrin E-nose) methods was used to assess the biochemical effects of CO\u2082 and N\u2082 atmospheres. Results show that NM enhances the accumulation of anthocyanins and polyphenols in both grapes and wine, likely due to differences in anaerobic metabolism. VOCs analysis and E-nose evaluation revealed only subtle aroma variations, suggesting sensory equivalence between CM and NM wines. From a sustainability perspective, nitrogen offers advantages in terms of safety, availability, and environmental impact. This dual analytical and environmental perspective supports NM as a viable and innovative technique for producing aromatic, pHenolic-rich wines with reduced ecological footprint.",
