  "abstract": "The prevalence of skin aging and the request for effective treatments have driven dermatological research towards natural solutions. This study investigates the anti-aging efficacy of two bioactive natural polyphenols, Oleocanthal and Oleacein, in a skincare formulation. A single-blind, randomized clinical trial involved 70 participants, using a comprehensive exclusion criterion to ensure participant safety and study integrity. Participants applied the Oleocanthal and Oleacein 1% serum formulation twice daily for 30 days. The efficacy was objectively assessed using the VISIA\u00aeSkin Analysis System at baseline, after 15 days, and after 30 days. Results indicated significant wrinkle reduction in most groups. For women aged 45-79 years, the mean change was -33.91% (95% CI: -46.75% to -21.07%). For men aged 20-44 years, it was -51.93% (95% CI: -76.54% to -27.33%), and for men aged 45-79 years, it was -46.56% (95% CI: -58.32% to -34.81%). For women aged 20-44 years, the change was -25.68% (95% CI: -63.91% to 12.54%), not statistically significant. These findings highlight the potential of EVOO-derived polyphenols in anti-aging skincare, particularly for older adults. This research paves the way for further exploration into natural compounds in dermatology, particularly for aging skin management.",
