  "abstract": "Oral inflammation and the immune response are distinct but related processes whereLinum usitatissimumL., fam. Linaceae represents a possible use for localized relief. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is an oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD) with an inflammatory background that mainly affects post- and peri-menopausal women. The presented methodology was threefold. Firstly, the plant extracts were made from flaxseeds of selected cultivars (Szafir [SZ] and Jantarol [JA]) containing plant lignans. In silico docking affinity was performed to verify the beta and alpha estrogen receptors of keratinocytes' (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) affinity for lignans from the plant extracts. Lastly, tests using living keratinocyte cell lines were performed. Adding the studied extracts from two cultivars of flaxseed-JA and SZ (10 \u00b5g/mL) reduced lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced cell inflammation markers levels of COX-2 and IL-6. The effect of JA was more pronounced than that of SZ, with statistical significance (p< 0.05). A high in silico affinity was provided during secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) docking to ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. Flaxseed's action could be based on the docking affinity of its major components to the estrogen receptors and the overall concentration of the elements of the extracts.",
