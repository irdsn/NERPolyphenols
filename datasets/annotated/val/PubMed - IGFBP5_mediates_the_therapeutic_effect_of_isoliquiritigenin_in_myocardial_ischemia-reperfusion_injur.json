  "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a critical problem in cardiovascular medicine, often occurring after coronary revascularization procedures or cardiopulmonary bypass. The characters of MIRI are both energy metabolism disturbances and severe myocardium insulin resistance (IR), which exacerbated myocardial damage and cell death. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid derived from licorice roots (Glycyrrhizaspp.), has demonstrated protective effects on MIRI. However, the potential cardio-protective effects and mechanism of ISL in MIRI remain unclear.",
