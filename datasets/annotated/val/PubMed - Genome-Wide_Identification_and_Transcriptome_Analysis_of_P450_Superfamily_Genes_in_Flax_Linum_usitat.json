  "abstract": "Flax (Linum usitatissimumL.) seed is rich in \u03b1-linolenic acid, lignans, and fiber, which have potential health benefits. However, the potential toxicity of its cyanogenic glycosides limits its widespread use. The cytochrome P450 gene family is one of the largest gene families in plants and is involved in synthesizing phytohormones, secondary metabolites, and various defense compounds. Two P450 genes have been found to be important enzymes for the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glycosides in common sorghum (Sorghum bicolor(L.) Moench). However, the P450 gene family and its involvement in cyanogenic glycoside synthesis have been less studied in flax. In previous studies, we assembled a high-quality flax genome. In this study, a total of 412 P450 genes were identified in the flax genome, with molecular weights in the range of 7.42 kDa to 154.5 kDa and encoding amino acid lengths between 67 and 1378. These genes belonged to 48 families under eight clans and were distributed across 15 chromosomes. The number of introns varied from 0 to 14. Thirty-nine cis-acting elements were identified within 1500 bp upstream of the promoter, mainly related to the light response. There were 147 segmental duplications and 53 tandem duplication events among these P450 genes. Eleven genes potentially related to cyanogenic glycoside synthesis were identified by transcriptome analysis, and the RT-qPCR results verified the reliability of the transcriptome analysis. This study lays the foundation for the classification and functional study of the flax P450 gene family. The results will be useful for breeding new low-cyanogenic-glycoside flax varieties by genetic engineering.",
