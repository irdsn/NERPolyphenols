  "title": "Enhancing wheat bran quality: Comparing the effects of conventional thermal processing and microwave-assisted hydrolysis.",
  "abstract": "Wheat bran is a source of bioactive compounds at a low cost, but the cell wall matrix notably limits the accessibility of bran bioactive compounds. This study investigated the effect of hot air oven treatment (C-HAO), microwave treatment (C-MWO), and microwave-assisted hydrolysis (HY-MW) on the quality attributes of wheat bran (WB) and explored its digestibility during in vitro digestion. Conventional treatments yielded the highest omega-6/omega-3 ratio, while the HY-MW process at 70\u00a0\u00b0C demonstrated the lowest and the best ratio. Conventional treatments showed higher volatile compound content, and HY-MW at 70\u00a0\u00b0C showed the lowest content (15.70\u00a0\u03bcg/g). It showed that HY-MW treatments effectively released WB phenolic compounds. Moreover, HY-MW treatments at 70\u00a0\u00b0C showed higher bioaccessible phenolic compounds content (1168\u00a0%) than raw WB. A combination of microwave and hydrolysis is a practical nonthermal approach to improve WB quality, which could facilitate the application of bran as a multifunctional nutrient.",
