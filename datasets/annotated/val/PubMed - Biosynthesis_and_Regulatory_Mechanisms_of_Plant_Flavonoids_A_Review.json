  "abstract": "Flavonoids are a class of secondary metabolites synthesized by plants, characterized by a C6-C3-C6 carbon skeleton and derived from the phenylpropane metabolism pathway. They play crucial biological roles, not only in plant pigment production and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses but also in medicinal applications. Consequently, the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanisms of flavonoids have been a focal point in plant transcription and gene expression research. The biosynthetic pathways of flavonoids include branches such as isoflavones, flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins, with some pathways and key enzymes already well-characterized. Studies indicate that plant flavonoids are regulated by various factors, including transcription factors, non-coding endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs), and plant hormones. This review systematically summarizes the structure and classification of plant flavonoids, their biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms, and the factors influencing flavonoid synthesis. By discussing the regulation of flavonoid-related gene expression in plants, this work provides valuable insights and a theoretical foundation for future research and applications of flavonoids.",
