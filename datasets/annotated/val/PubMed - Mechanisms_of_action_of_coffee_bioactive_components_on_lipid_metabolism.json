  "abstract": "Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes, which may be related to the effects of coffee and its bioactive components on lipid metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, a known neuromodulator that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, as well as other components, such as chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, cafestol and kahweol. Thus, this review discusses the up-to-date knowledge of mechanisms of action of coffee and its bioactive compounds on lipid metabolism. Although there is evidence that coffee and/or its bioactive compounds regulate transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and sterol regulatory element binding proteins) and enzymes (e.g. AMP-activated protein kinase) involved in lipogenesis, lipid uptake, transport, fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and/or lipolysis, needs for the understanding of coffee and its effects on lipid metabolism in humans remain to be answered.",
