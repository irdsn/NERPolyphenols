  "abstract": "In pursuit of sustainable, biodegradable packaging with controlled-release functionality for food preservation, we have developed a novel composite xylan/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) based composite film. Fabricated by cross-linking sodium polyacrylate POSS with xylan molecules, the film features robust mechanical properties (11.56\u00a0MPa strength, 489.67\u00a0% elongation) and enhanced thermal stability. Migration tests in various liquid environments confirm contaminant levels far below 10\u00a0mg/dm2, attesting to its safety for food contact. Besides, natural antimicrobial agent, thymol is effectively loaded onto the xylan/POSS matrix to enhance the film's antioxidant and anti-mold performance. Typically, when applied to winter jujube and strawberries, the film preserves fruit quality-retaining 84\u00a0% freshness after one week and preventing undesirable color changes. Moreover, thymol is proved to release steadily over ten days at high environmental humidity. Overall, the xylan/POSS based composite film integrates biodegradability and controlled thymol release, offers a promising and innovative strategy for extending fruit shelf life.",
