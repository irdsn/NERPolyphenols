  "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with many conditions and diseases, including periodontal diseases that affect tooth-supporting tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a cocoa extract (Theobroma cacao L.) on F. nucleatum with respect to growth, biofilm formation, adherence, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. The anti-inflammatory properties and the effect on epithelial barrier function of the cocoa extract were also assessed. The cocoa extract, whose major phenolic compound is epicatechin, dose-dependently inhibited the growth, biofilm formation, adherence properties (basement membrane matrix, oral epithelial cells), and H2S production of F. nucleatum. It also decreased IL-6 and IL-8 production by F. nucleatum-stimulated oral epithelial cells and inhibited F. nucleatum-induced NF-\u03baB activation in monocytes. Lastly, the cocoa extract enhanced the barrier function of an oral epithelial model by increasing the transepithelial electrical resistance. We provide evidence that the beneficial properties of an epicatechin-rich cocoa extract may be useful for preventing and/or treating periodontal diseases.",
