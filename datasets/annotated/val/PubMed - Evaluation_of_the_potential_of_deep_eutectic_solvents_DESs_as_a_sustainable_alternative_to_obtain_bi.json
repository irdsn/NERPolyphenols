  "abstract": "Taturuba (Pouteria macrophylla), a native Amazonian fruit, is a rich source of phenolic compounds with potent antioxidant properties. This study evaluates the efficiency of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as sustainable extraction agents and their role in stabilizing bioactive compounds. To achieve this, the raw material was characterized in terms of its sugar, amino acid, mineral, and phenolic acid profiles. Bioactive compound extraction was performed using DESs (choline chloride + acetic acid (ClC: AcA), choline chloride + lactic acid (ClC:AcL), menthol + lactic acid (Men:AcL)) and 80\u00a0% ethanol (Et:Ag), combined with maceration (MA) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The extracts were then analyzed for phenolic content and antioxidant activity. To enhance stability, the extracted phenolic compounds were encapsulated using extrusion and ionotropic gelation, and the microcapsules were evaluated for morphology and stability under different storage conditions. Chromatographic analysis revealed that the peel+pulp fraction contained high levels of gallic acid (9446.978\u00a0\u03bcg/g) and syringic acid (2462.715\u00a0\u03bcg/g), along with significant amounts of sucrose (1.659\u00a0g/100\u00a0g), fructose (1.545\u00a0g/100\u00a0g), and iron (26.748\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g). The seed fraction was rich in proteins, particularly leucine (0.61\u00a0g/100\u00a0g), lysine (0.36\u00a0g/100\u00a0g), and valine (0.44\u00a0g/100\u00a0g). The peel+pulp fraction extracted with Et:Ag under ultrasound-assisted conditions exhibited the highest phenolic content (24.330\u00a0mg GAE/g), along with DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities exceeding 90\u00a0%. ClC:AcA was the most efficient DES for flavonoid extraction in both fractions. Encapsulation effectively produced uniform microcapsules; however, protective efficiency varied with storage conditions. While phenolics retained their bioactivity in the absence of light, exposure to light significantly reduced their stability. This study underscores the potential of Pouteria macrophylla as a sustainable source of bioactive compounds, with promising applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. By integrating DES-based extraction and encapsulation technologies, this research advances environmentally friendly methodologies while providing critical insights into the stability and functionality of bioactive compounds.",
