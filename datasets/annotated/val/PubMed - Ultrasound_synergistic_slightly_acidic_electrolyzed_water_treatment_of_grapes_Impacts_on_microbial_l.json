  "abstract": "Microbial contamination is the principal factor in the deterioration of postharvest storage quality in grapes. To mitigate this issue, we explored a synergistic treatment which combines ultrasound (US) and slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW), and rigorously compared with conventional water cleaning (CW), exclusive US treatment, and standalone SAEW treatment. The US\u00a0+\u00a0SAEW treatment proved to be markedly superior in reducing total bacterial, mold & yeast counts on grapes. Specifically, it achieved reductions of 2.23 log CFU/g and 2.76 log CFU/g, respectively, exceeding the efficiencies of SAEW (0.78, 0.75), US (0.58, 0.65), and CW (0.24, 0.46). The efficacy of this synergistic treatment is attributed to the ultrasound removal of the wax layer on grape skins, which transitions the skin from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. This alteration increases the contact area between the grape surface and SAEW, thereby enhancing the antimicrobial efficacy of SAEW. From a physicochemical quality standpoint, the US\u00a0+\u00a0SAEW treatment exhibited multiple advantages. It not only minimized weight loss, color deviations, polyphenol oxidase activity and malondialdehyde synthesis in comparison to CW-treated samples but also preserved firmness, sugar-acid ratio and the activities of key enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, and thus maintaining high levels of total phenolics, total ascorbic acid, total anthocyanins, and antioxidants. Consequently, US\u00a0+\u00a0SAEW treatment put off the times of decay onset in grapes by 12\u00a0days, outperforming both SAEW (8) and US (4) in comparison to CW. These results highlight the potential of US\u00a0+\u00a0SAEW as an effective strategy for maintaining grape quality during their postharvest storage period.",
