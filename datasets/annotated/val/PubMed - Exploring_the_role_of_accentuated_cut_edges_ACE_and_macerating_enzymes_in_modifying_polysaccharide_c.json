  "abstract": "Our previous study demonstrated a potential strategy for modifying the phenolics profile of Marquette red wines, through the synergistic effect of Accentuated Cut Edges (ACE) and macerating enzymes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of these two winemaking techniques on the microstructure of grape skins and the composition of soluble polysaccharides in Marquette red wines at crushing, bottling, and aging. Even though ACE had no effect on polysaccharide composition, the macerating enzymes significantly altered the mole % of individual monosaccharides and the ratios of arabinose to galactose, rhamnose/galacturonic acid, and (arabinose + galactose)/rhamnose. Consequently, the loss of arabinose residues from the neutral sugar side chains (e.g., arabinogalactan protein) of soluble pectic polysaccharides was observed, primarily due to the activity of \u03b1-N-arabinofuranosidase. This compositional shift could potentially alter tannin-polysaccharide aggregation and facilitate tannin extraction due to the depectinization and degradation of grape skin cell walls.",
