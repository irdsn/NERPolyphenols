  "abstract": "Diabetic wound healing remains clinically challenging due to persistent oxidative stress and dysregulated inflammation caused by the pathological microenvironment, particularly excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). A near-infrared (NIR)-responsive multifunctional microneedle system (Res@ZIF-67/Ce0.1Mn0.9-MMON, RZCM) integrating antioxidant, antibacterial, and angiogenic functionalities is developed. The microneedle substrate incorporates Ce0.1Mn0.9-MMON nanoparticles that synergistically exert antibacterial effects through peroxidase-mimetic activity and NIR-induced photothermal hyperthermia, while concurrently mimicking superoxide dismutase and catalase activities to scavenge ROS and alleviate hypoxia. The microneedle tips encapsulate pH-responsive Res@ZIF-67 nanoparticles that release cobalt ions (Co2+) and resveratrol in acidic environments, cooperatively stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) under normoxic conditions to promote angiogenesis. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that RZCM accelerates diabetic wound healing through coordinated mechanisms: photothermal bacterial eradication, ROS scavenging (85.7% reduction), macrophage M2 polarization (2.3 fold increase), HIF-1\u03b1-mediated neovascularization (2.1 fold higher CD31 density), and enhanced collagen remodeling (78.4% increased collagen I/III ratio). This multifunctional system achieves complete epithelialization within 14 days, outperforming conventional treatments. By integrating multi-enzyme mimetic nanomaterials with microenvironment-responsive drug delivery, RZCM establishes a novel therapeutic paradigm for chronic wound management, demonstrating significant translational potential for diabetic wound care through synergistic regulation of oxidative, inflammatory, and angiogenic pathways.",
