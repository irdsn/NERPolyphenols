  "title": "Integrated widely targeted metabolomics and flavoromics reveal processing-driven dynamic changes in functional metabolites ofEucommia ulmoidesleaf tea.",
  "abstract": "This study employed a widely targeted metabolomics approach combined with flavoromics evaluation to systematically analyze dynamic metabolic variations under four processing techniques: fresh EUL (XY), traditionally dried EUL (HG), green tea processed EUL (GT), and black tea processed EUL (BT). A total of 1839 non-volatile metabolites and 289 volatile metabolites were identified. Key affected metabolites included amino acids (e.g., essential amino acids upregulated 90\u202f% in HG), lipids (oxidized fatty acids elevated in BT), phenolic acids (23\u202f% increase in GT), flavonoids (120+ downregulated in BT), nucleotides, and terpenoids. Each processing method demonstrates unique advantages: HG preserves amino acids, GT enhances catechin content, and BT optimizes secondary metabolites. This study provides the first comprehensive metabolic map of EUL processing, offering a scientific foundation for standardizing product quality and developing functional applications.",
