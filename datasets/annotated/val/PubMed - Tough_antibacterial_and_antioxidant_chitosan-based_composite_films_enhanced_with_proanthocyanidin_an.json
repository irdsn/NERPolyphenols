  "abstract": "Post-harvest fruits are susceptible to microbial infections and spoilage, and the development of multifunctional green preservation films to extend the shelf-life of fruits is desirable. In this study, multifunctional antibacterial and antioxidant fruit preservation films were developed by incorporating natural plant actives of proanthocyanidins and carvacrol essential oils into chitosan-dialdehyde cellulose composite films. The composite film had good mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 78.8\u00a0MPa, a free radical scavenging rate of over 90\u00a0%, and enhanced barrier properties against UV light and water vapor. The diameters of the inhibition zones of the composite film for S. aureus and E. coli were 23.65\u00a0mm and 22.37\u00a0mm, respectively. In addition, the composite film was biocompatible and the survival rate of cells treated with the composite film solution was more than 90\u00a0%. Using strawberries as model fruit, we showed that the composite film could effectively inhibit the growth of colonies on the surface of the fruit and reduce the weight loss rate. These results demonstrated that the composite film has great potential for fruit preservation.",
