  "abstract": "Zearalenone (ZEA), one of the most common mycotoxins in moldy plants, can cause ferroptosis in the liver. Hyperoside (Hyp) is mainly derived from Hypericum perforatum and exerts hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. It is not known whether Hyp alleviates ZEA-induced ferroptosis-related damage AIM: The protective effect of Hyp on ZEA-induced liver injury was studied and its underlying mechanisms were elucidated.",
