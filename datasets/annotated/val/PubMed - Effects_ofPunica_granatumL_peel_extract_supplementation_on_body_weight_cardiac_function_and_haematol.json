  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of pathological conditions well described in humans but still investigated insufficiently in animals. A novel approach in its management is the utilisation of nutrients from natural sources. Recent studies suggested that phenolic compounds from pomegranate peel could be a promising dietary intervention for MetS. This study evaluated the potency of polyphenol-rich pomegranate peel extract (EPP) in mitigating some MetS components in an animal model.",
