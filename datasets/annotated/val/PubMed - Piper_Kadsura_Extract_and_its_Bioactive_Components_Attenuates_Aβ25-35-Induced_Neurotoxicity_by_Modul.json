  "title": "Piper Kadsura Extract and its Bioactive Components Attenuates A\u03b225-35-Induced Neurotoxicity by Modulating Glycolysis and Activating the SIRT1/PPAR\u03b3/GLUT1 Axis.",
  "abstract": "Piper kadsura (Choisy) Ohwi, a traditional medicinal plant used in East Asia, is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its bioactive components, such as Hancinone and Futoquinol, show potential in treating neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aim of the study: This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of Piper kadsura extract (PK) and its active components, Hancinone (C1) and Futoquinol (C2), in A\u03b225-35-induced AD models. PK, C1, and C2 were evaluated in A\u03b225-35-induced PC-12 and N9 cells, as well as a mouse model of AD. Cellular assays, Seahorse analysis, and molecular docking were used to explore glycolysis, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed via 16\u00a0S rDNA sequencing. PK, C1, and C2 significantly improved cell viability, restored glycolysis, and reduced oxidative stress by activating the SIRT1/PPAR\u03b3/GLUT1 pathway. PK also alleviated neuronal damage and enhanced cognitive performance in mice. Gut microbiota analysis revealed increased beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) and enriched glycolysis-related pathways. Piper kadsura and its components exhibit multifaceted neuroprotective effects by modulating energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the gut-brain axis. These findings support the therapeutic potential of Piper kadsura in AD treatment.",
