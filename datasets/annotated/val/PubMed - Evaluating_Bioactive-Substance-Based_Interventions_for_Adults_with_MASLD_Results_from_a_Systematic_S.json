  "title": "Evaluating Bioactive-Substance-Based Interventions for Adults with MASLD: Results from a Systematic Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "Objective: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a chronic condition affecting a broad population. This review aimed to identify and summarize the current evidence on bioactive-substance-based interventions for adults with MASLD, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), covering publications from 2000 to 2023.Methods: A search was conducted across six databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Food Science Source, and SPORTDiscus) for randomized controlled trials and other study types (e.g., prospective cohort studies and systematic reviews), reflecting the scoping nature of this review. The search was limited to studies in adults (>18 years old), with an intervention of interest and at least one comparator group.Results: A total of 4572 articles were retrieved, with 201 full-text articles screened for eligibility. Of these, 131 primary studies and 49 systematic reviews were included in the scoping review. The most studied bioactive substances were Curcumin (Turmeric) (n = 25), Silymarin (Milk Thistle) (n = 17), Resveratrol (n = 10), Coffee (n = 7), Green Tea (n = 5), and Berberine (n = 5 each). Moreover, 46 studies reported on 36 other bioactive substances with 2 or fewer articles each. Among the included systematic reviews, 13 focused on Curcumin, 12 on Coffee or Tea, 10 on bioactive substance combinations, 6 on Resveratrol, and 2 each on Silymarin and Artichoke Leaf. The included studies showed substantial heterogeneity in reported outcomes, which primarily focused on hepatic health, body weight, adverse events, glycemic control, blood lipids, and body composition.Conclusions: This scoping review highlights a range of bioactive substances used in the treatment of MASLD. While evidence is abundant for bioactive substances like Curcumin and Silymarin, further research and synthesis of findings is necessary to establish the clinical efficacy of all bioactive substances.",
