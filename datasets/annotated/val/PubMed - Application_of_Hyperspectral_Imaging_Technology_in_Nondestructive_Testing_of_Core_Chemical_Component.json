  "title": "Application of Hyperspectral Imaging Technology in Nondestructive Testing of Core Chemical Components of Fruits.",
  "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), as a nondestructive testing method integrating spectral analysis and spatial imaging, has shown unique advantages in the dynamic monitoring of the core chemical components of fruits. In this paper, we focus on the application of HSI in the detection of core components of fruits, such as carbohydrates, organic acids, water, and polyphenols, and systematically analyze its chemical response mechanism and technical bottleneck. By comparison of the spectral differences of chemical bond vibration and electron jump features, the dynamic correlation between HSI and quality parameters such as sugar and acidity is revealed. Then, the problems and challenges faced by hyperspectral imaging technology in the nondestructive detection of the core chemical composition of fruits in terms of data processing, environmental interference, and equipment cost are discussed, and conclusions and outlook of the potential and prospect of hyperspectral imaging technology in the detection of the core chemical composition of fruits are presented to provide a powerful technical support for the detection of the core chemical composition of fruits.",
