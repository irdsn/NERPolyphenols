  "title": "Crosstalk between adipogenesis and aging: role of polyphenols in combating adipogenic-associated aging.",
  "abstract": "In the last forty years, the number of people over 60 years of age has increased significantly owing to better nutrition and lower rates of infectious diseases in developing countries. Aging significantly impacts adipose tissue, which plays crucial role in hormone regulation and energy storage. This can lead to imbalances in glucose, and overall energy homeostasis within the body. Aging is irreversible phenomena and potentially causing lipid infiltration in other organs, leading to systemic inflammation, metabolic disorders. This review investigates various pathways contributing to aging-related defects in adipogenesis, such as changes in adipose tissue function and distribution. Polyphenols, a diverse group of natural compounds, can mitigate aging effects via free radicals, oxidative stress, inflammation, senescence, and age-related diseases. Polyphenols like resveratrol, quercetin and EGCG exhibit distinct mechanisms and regulate crucial pathways, such as the TGF-\u03b2, AMPK, Wnt, PPAR-\u03b3, and C/EBP transcription factors, and influence epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification. This review highlights the critical importance of understanding the intricate relationship between aging and adipogenesis for optimizing well-being with increasing age. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of polyphenols like quercetin and resveratrol in enhancing adipose tissue function and promoting healthy aging.",
