  "abstract": "In the present study we evaluated the efficacy of a bioformulation ofStreptomyces cameroonensisfor control of black pod disease in cocoa and enhancement of seedling growth. The formulation developed using talc powder and cassava starch as carriers showed high shelf-life of 1.07 \u00d7 106CFU/g after six months storage at 4\u00b0C. The formulation was tested for inhibition of spore germination inPhytophthora megakaryaand showed 100% inhibition at 10% (w/v) of formulation. To determine the efficacy of the formulation, we performed anin plantaassay in the greenhouse on two hybrids of cocoa seedlings, the tolerant SNK413 \u00d7 (\u2642) T79/467 and the susceptible UPA 134\u00d7 (\u2642) SCA 12. Detached leaf assay showed a significant reduction in the disease severity index of about 67% for the tolerant hybrid and 55% for the susceptible hybrid compared to non-treated plants. A significant enhancement in stem length, leaf surface area and root weight was observed. Analysis of biochemical markers of defense showed a significant increase in total polyphenol, flavonoid, and total protein contents. There was also significant upregulation of PR-proteins such as chitinases, peroxidases and \u03b2-1, 3-glucanases following treatment of both tolerant and susceptible hybrids, though with a higher level of synthesis in the tolerant hybrids. A significant increase was also observed in polyphenol oxidase activities in plants treated with the formulation. This work demonstrated the stability and effectiveness of theS. cameroonensispowder formulation in suppressing black pod disease in cocoa and subsequently enhancing the growth of seedlings.",
