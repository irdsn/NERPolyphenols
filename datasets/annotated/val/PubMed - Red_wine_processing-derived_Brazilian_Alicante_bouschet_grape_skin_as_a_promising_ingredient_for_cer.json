  "abstract": "Grape skin is a wine by-product with a high fiber and phenolic compound content, with potential application as an ingredient in food products. This work aimed to study the hedonic and sensory perception of the consumer using the Check-all-that-apply about cereal bars made with grape skin flour (GSF) obtained from wine residue. Grape skin flour with different granulometric ranges (coarse and fine) was added to the cereal bars in different proportions (10, 15, and 20%) to replace the oat flakes present in the formulation. Sensory acceptance results showed that all bars had good acceptance scores (>6.42) and presented different sensory profiles. The cereal bar containing 15% of coarse GSF had good sensory acceptance with attributes \"few dark spots,\" \"light color,\" and \"softer,\" with desirable sensory characteristics and from the nutritional point of view with high fiber content and bioactive compounds and it was considered the best formulation. Therefore, the incorporation of wine by-products in cereal bars showed excellent acceptability and the possibility of insertion in the market.",
