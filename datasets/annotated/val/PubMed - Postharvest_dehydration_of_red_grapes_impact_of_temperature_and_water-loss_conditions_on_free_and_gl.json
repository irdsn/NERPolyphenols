  "abstract": "Postharvest dehydration affects the metabolism of grapes, impacting odorous secondary metabolites and therefore the features of the corresponding passito wines - high-quality products with winemaking practices linked to specific territories and related autochthonous grape varieties. Water loss and temperature conditions are the main variables of the dehydration process. This study assessed how they impacted the patterns of free and glycosylated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of the exocarp (pulp) and epicarp (skin) in Nebbiolo and Aleatico, a neutral and semi-aromatic red grape variety, respectively. Dehydration parameters were set in tunnel conditions, and VOCs were quantitatively analyzed by solid phase extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.",
