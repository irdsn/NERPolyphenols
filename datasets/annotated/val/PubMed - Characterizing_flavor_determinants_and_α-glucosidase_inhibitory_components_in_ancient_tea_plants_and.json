  "abstract": "This study aimed to compare white teas derived from ancient tea plants (AT) and the cultivar 'Qiancha 1' (QC1) using multi-omics approaches, focusing on differences in volatile/non-volatile components, sensory traits, and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Both teas shared sweet aromas and mellow tastes, but AT exhibited significantly stronger floral intensity (p<\u00a00.05), whereas QC1 dominated in citrus/fruity aroma. GC-olfactometry and chemometric modeling identified six key metabolites, with trans-\u03b2-ionone (rOAV\u00a0=\u00a0149.6) and \u03b2-damascenone (rOAV\u00a0=\u00a047.6) driving floral and citrus/fruity characteristics, respectively. Targeted metabolomics revealed significantly higher levels of ester-catechins, caffeine, and gallic acid in AT. These compounds exhibited significant dose-response correlations with bitterness, astringency, and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (r=\u00a00.83-0.93,p\u00a0<0.05), suggesting their dual role in flavor enhancement and hypoglycemic potential. This work provides scientific evidence and technical insights for the high-value utilization of ancient tea plants resources and the optimization of white tea processing technologies.",
