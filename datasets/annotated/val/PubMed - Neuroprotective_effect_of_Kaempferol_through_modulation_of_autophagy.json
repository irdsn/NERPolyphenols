  "abstract": "Objective:Autophagy is a critical cellular mechanism that ensures the breakdown of damaged or unnecessary components. This process helps ensure cellular health by maintaining cellular balance, protecting cells from stress, and providing an alternative energy source during metabolic stress. Disruptions in autophagy have been linked to neurological disorders.Method:In this review, the neuroprotective effects of Kaempferol through autophagy modulation are elaborated. Methods: An electronic search in scientific databases was performed to find relevant studies exploring the neuroprotective effects of kaempferol mediated via modulation of autophagy.Results:Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid found in fruits, vegetables, and plant-based products like tea, has been shown to demonstrate a variety of health-promoting properties, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory effects. This review summarizes the current understanding of how Kaempferol modulates autophagy and discusses its potential impact on various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ischemic stroke, and depression. Studies increasingly indicate that Kaempferol could be a vital factor in maintaining neural health by influencing autophagy mechanisms.Conclusion:Numerous studies have established Kaempferol's neuroprotective potential through autophagy regulation, which suggests opprotunities for potential therapeutic applications.",
