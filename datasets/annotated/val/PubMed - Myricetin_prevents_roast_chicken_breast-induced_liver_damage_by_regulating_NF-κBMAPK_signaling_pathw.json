  "abstract": "Roast chicken breast contains a certain number of heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which induces damage of liver, colon, and other organs. Myricetin (MY) is a polyhydroxyl flavonol compound known for its anti-inflammatory and various other pharmacological activities, but its mechanisms related to alleviating HCAS-induced liver inflammation are unclear.",
