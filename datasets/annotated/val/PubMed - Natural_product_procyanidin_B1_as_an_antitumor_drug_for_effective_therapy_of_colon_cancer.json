  "abstract": "Traditional chemotherapy drugs have definite antitumor mechanisms and good therapeutic efficacy; however, their poor water solubility, serious side effects and drug resistance limit their clinical application. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reported for the first time thein vivoandin vitroanticancer effects of procyanidin B1 (PCB1), a compound that is isolated from natural sources such as grape seeds, apples, peanut skin and cranberries. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay showed that PCB1 effectively decreased the number of viable HCT-116 cells compared with cells treated with the small molecule cytotoxic drug doxorubicin. Quantitative PCR and apoptosis analysis, Cell cycle analysis, and WB analysis) of the molecular mechanism showed that PCB1 induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in S phase by increasing expression of pro-apoptosis protein caspase-3 and BAX and decreasing expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. The efficient antitumor activity of PCB1 was demonstrated throughin vivoexperiments on a xenograft mouse model, demonstrating that PCB1 significantly suppressed tumor growth. The present study suggested that PCB1 represents a novel class of plant-based compounds isolated from natural sources that can be applied as an anticancer drug.",
