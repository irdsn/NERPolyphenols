  "abstract": "To enhance the 3D printing capabilities of fibrin gel, this study systematically investigated the effects of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), chlorogenic acid (CA), and sodium alginate (SA) on gel properties. All three additives improved gel performance, with CA demonstrating exceptional efficacy: it reduced gelation time by 30.78\u00a0% while increasing gel strength, hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness, and thrombin activity by 62.69\u00a0%, 19.46\u00a0%, 38.32\u00a0%, 30.76\u00a0%, and 31.10\u00a0%, respectively. Structural characterization revealed that STPP and CA promoted secondary structure transitions, yielding denser 3D networks, whereas SA exhibited no secondary structural modifications. Fluorescence spectroscopy and intermolecular force analysis further revealed that CA exhibited the strongest covalent, disulfide, hydrogen, and hydrophobic interactions among them, furthermore STPP and SA also had stronger disulfide bonding, hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding than the control. Overall, CA demonstrated the most favorable gel properties, attributed to the densest gel structures driven by the strongest intermolecular forces and enhanced thrombin activity.",
