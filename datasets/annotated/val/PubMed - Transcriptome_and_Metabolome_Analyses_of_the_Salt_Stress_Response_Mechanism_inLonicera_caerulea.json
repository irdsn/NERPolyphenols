  "abstract": "Lonicera caeruleais a wild fruit species with high edible and medicinal value. However, the molecular regulation and metabolic mechanisms ofL. caeruleaunder salt stress are still unclear. Salt stress causes damage to the cell membrane ofL. caeruleaand induces changes in malondialdehyde content, relative electrolyte leakage, leaves' stomatal opening, and the water loss rate. It also increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of soluble sugars. A comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis ofL. caeruleaexposed to salt stress at four different (treatment) time intervals yielded a total of 99,574 unigenes and 1375 metabolites. Among these, 4081, 4042, and 4403 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 12 transcriptomes, while 776, 832, and 793 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were detected in 12 metabolomes. The DEGs play important roles in several signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling, fatty acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs and DAMs are associated with flavonoid and lipid biosynthesis pathways. The combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses suggest that flavonoid and fatty acid compounds may be involved in regulating plant responses to salt stress. These findings will lay the foundation for the selection ofL. caeruleagermplasm resources and the expansion of its cultivation area. These research findings will lay the foundation for the cultivation of salt-tolerant new varieties ofL. caeruleaand their planting in saline-alkali soils.",
