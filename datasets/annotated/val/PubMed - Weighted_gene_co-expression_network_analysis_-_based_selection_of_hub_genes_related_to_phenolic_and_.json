  "abstract": "Sorghum grains are rich in phenolic compounds, which are noted for their anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as volatile compounds (VOCs) that contribute to aroma and fermentation processes. There is a known close relationship between sorghum coat color and phenolic compound content (PCC), particularly flavonoids which are pigments that confer red and purple colors in flowers and seeds.",
