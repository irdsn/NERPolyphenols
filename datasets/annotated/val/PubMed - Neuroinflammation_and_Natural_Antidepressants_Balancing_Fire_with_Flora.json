  "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major global health concern that is intimately linked to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and complicated metabolic abnormalities. Traditional antidepressants frequently fall short, highlighting the urgent need for new, safer, and more acceptable therapeutic techniques. Phytochemicals, i.e., natural antidepressants derived from plants, are emerging as powerful plant-based therapies capable of targeting many pathogenic pathways at the same time.Summary: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from preclinical and clinical studies on the efficacy of phytochemicals such as curcumin, polyphenols, flavonoids, and alkaloids in lowering depressed symptoms. Consistent data show that these substances have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, altering neuroimmune interactions, reducing oxidative damage, and improving mitochondrial resilience. Particularly, polyphenols and flavonoids have great therapeutic potential because of their capacity to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, inhibit cytokine activity, and encourage neuroplasticity mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Despite promising results, the heterogeneity in study designs, phytochemical formulations, and patient demographics highlights the importance of thorough, standardized clinical studies.Conclusions: This review identifies phytochemicals as compelling adjuvant or independent therapies in depression treatment, providing multimodal mechanisms and enhanced tolerability. Additional research into improved dosage, pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, and integrative therapy approaches is essential. Using phytotherapeutics could considerably improve holistic and customized depression care, encouraging new research routes in integrative neuroscience and clinical psychiatry.",
