  "abstract": "This work aimed to study the chemical composition and evaluate thein vitrophotochemoprotective potential of an emulsion containing bioactive plant material obtained fromEugenia neoverrucosaSobral leaves. The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) was selected for its high content of total phenolics and high antioxidant capacity. Chemical analysis using 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy identified three ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids - corosolic acid (1), 3-O-\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl-pomolic acid (2), and pomolic acid (3) - and one phenolic acid, gallic acid (4). EAF showed no cytotoxicity and exhibited photochemoprotective and cytoprotective activities, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and preserving catalase activity in UVB-irradiated L929 fibroblasts. Emulsions containing EAF, the synthetic UVB filter homosalate (HMS), and their combination were developed and evaluated. EAF emulsion enhanced antioxidant activity, while its combination with HMS improved UVB absorption and photoprotective efficacy. These findings highlight EAF's potential as a multifunctional ingredient for innovative photoprotective formulations to mitigate oxidative stress and promote skin health.",
