  "abstract": "Chive seed flavonoid (CSF) exhibits antioxidant, digestive, and immunomodulatory properties, yet their effects on ruminant intestinal development and microbial ecosystems remain underexplored. This study systematically evaluated CSF supplementation (0.25% of concentrate) on intestinal morphology, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) dynamics, and microbiota composition in 16 weaned Hu lambs (3 months; 19.57 \u00b1 1.56 kg initial weight) using histomorphometry, VFA quantification, and full-length 16S rRNA sequencing. Animals were randomly allocated to a control (basal diet) or CSF-supplemented group (T), following a 7-day adaptation and 90-day experimental protocol. Key findings revealed: (1) The T group demonstrated increased jejunal and ileal villus length (p< 0.05), elevated villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (V/C;p< 0.05), thickened muscular layers (p< 0.05), and reduced crypt depth (p< 0.05). (2) CSF supplementation significantly elevated acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total VFAs (p< 0.05) in ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum, with notable jejunal propionate and total VFAs increases (p< 0.05). (3) Upregulated expression of ileal and cecal genes (IGF1,CD81,CTNNBL1,SLC39A8) linked to tissue morphogenesis and VFAs absorption was observed in the T group (p< 0.01). (4) Full-length 16S analysis demonstrated CSF-enhanced microbial diversity and selective enrichment ofCyanobacteriota,Bacillus,Acetobacterium, andStreptomyces[Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis]. Regional microbial shifts includedBacteroidotaproliferation in the small intestine and rectum,Actinomycetotadominance in duodenum/cecum/colon, and ileal enrichment ofBacillota,Clostridium, andStreptomyces. KEGG pathway analysis confirmed CSF-driven enhancements in carbohydrate/energy metabolism, immune regulation, and intestinal barrier pathways (p< 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 0.25% CSF improved intestinal morphology, increased the production of VFAs, and optimized microbial composition, thereby promoting intestinal health in sheep. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of CSF in promoting healthy production in sheep.",
