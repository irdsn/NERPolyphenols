  "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the major causes of death worldwide. Onion peels have antioxidant and antidiabetic activities due to the presence of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. In current research, the antidiabetic potential of a herbal-based silver nanodrug synthesized using aqueous extract ofAllium cepapeels was studied against Alloxan-induced diabetes in rabbits. The green synthesized reduced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and aqueous extract were characterized using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS-MS) analysis. After the acclimation period, the rabbits were divided into nine groups of 5 rabbits each (n=\u20095). Experimental animals were injected with a single dose of Alloxan monohydrate (160\u2009mg/mL per kg BW) and then orally treated with aqueous extract ofA. cepapeels and AgNPs at three dose concentrations (100, 200, 300\u2009mg/mL per kg BW) for 20\u2009days. Serum levels of blood sugar, renal function tests, lipid profile, and oxidative stress markers were determined photometrically. Results from mass spectral analysis revealed that quercetin and vanillic acid are the major phenolic compounds. XRD analysis confirmed the stabilization and shape of green synthesized AgNPs. Results from in\u00a0vivo studies indicated that treatment with aqueous extract ofA. cepapeels and AgNPs attenuated the Alloxan-induced diabetes in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by a decrease in blood sugar, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, and cholesterol to 100\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8, 57.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8, 38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8, 1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, 40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u2009mg/dL, respectively, in rabbits administered with 300\u2009mg/mL per kg BW AgNPs. The levels of oxidative stress markers (CAT, SOD, and GPx) in blood, that is, 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, 918\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009IU/mL, respectively, were also increased in rabbits administered with 300\u2009mg/mL per kg BW AgNPs. Our results conclude that synthesized AgNPs using aqueous extract ofA. cepapeels have a protective effect against Alloxan-induced diabetes.",
