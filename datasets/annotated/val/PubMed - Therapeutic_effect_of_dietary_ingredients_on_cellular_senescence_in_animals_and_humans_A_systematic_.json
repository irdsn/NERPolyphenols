  "abstract": "Cellular senescence has been regarded as a therapeutic target for ageing and age-related diseases. Several senotherapeutic agents have been proposed, including compounds derived from natural products which hold the translational potential to promote healthy ageing. This systematic review examined the association of dietary ingredients with cellular senescence in animals and humans, with an intent to identify dietary ingredients with senotherapeutic potential.",
