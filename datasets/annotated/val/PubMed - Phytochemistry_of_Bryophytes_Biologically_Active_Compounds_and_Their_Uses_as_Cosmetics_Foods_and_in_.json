  "abstract": "Little prior attention has been paid to the use of bryophytes in the human diet as foods, cosmetics, and medicines, despite there being 23,000 species known worldwide. Some mosses and liverworts produce significant levels of terpenoids and phenolic compounds possessing characteristic odors and tastes, as well as exhibiting cytotoxic, antioxidant, muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, and many other activities. In addition, vitamin B2and tocopherols, as well as prostaglandin-like highly unsaturated fatty acids are produced by these organisms. In this contribution, the distribution in bryophytes of terpenoids, aromatic compounds, and polyketides, having biological and pharmacological activity, and their possible uses as cosmetics and foods, and in drug development are discussed.",
