  "abstract": "Red pepper sauce is a traditional Chinese condiment, which is rich in nutrients and popular worldwide. However, the changes in the microbial community of red pepper sauce during fermentation and the effects of such changes on quality stability have been under studied. In this study, we systematically analyzed the relationship between the microbial community composition of multiple red pepper sauces and the biochemical indexes. Moreover, we also explored the dynamics of changes in the microbial community composition using metabarcoding sequencing.",
