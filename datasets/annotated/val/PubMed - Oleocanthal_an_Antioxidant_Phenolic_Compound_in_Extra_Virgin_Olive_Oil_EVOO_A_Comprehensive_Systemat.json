  "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is linked to various health benefits, especially the consumption of olive oil as a key component. Multiple studies highlight its advantages, particularly due to its fatty acid composition and additional components like phenolic compounds. A significant antioxidant compound, oleocanthal, known for its antioxidant properties, has gained attention in the pharmaceutical industry for its anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects. It shows promise in addressing cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and neuroprotection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the existing literature on oleocanthal, examining its role in biological processes and potential impact on conditions like inflammation and cancer.",
