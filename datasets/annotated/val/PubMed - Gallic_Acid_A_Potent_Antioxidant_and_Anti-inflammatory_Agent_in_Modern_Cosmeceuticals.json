  "abstract": "The cosmetics business is a valuable and stable multibillion-dollar business that keeps growing yearly with new, specialized goods. Natural goods contain a wealth of medicinally active chemicals used to treat a wide range of skin problems, including infections, inflammation, and damage caused by UV light and pollution. Cosmeceuticals are a mix of cosmetic and medical chemicals. Based on their main ingredients, they can be used for both beauty and health purposes. Many people think that natural goods are a great way to obtain cosmeceuticals. It has strong antiinflammatory, antibacterial, anti-cancer, and protective properties. The benefit for the skin has been said to be the most interesting. GA and its products have been used a lot as an adjuvant in many therapeutic formulations, as an alternative to hydro-cortisone in children with atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases, and as an ingredient in cosmetics because they are good for humans. GA is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the US Food and Drug Administration. Oxidative stress, which happens when too many free radicals build up, is the main cause of many skin diseases that get worse over time, like aging. Polyphenols, including gallic acid, represent a significant category of naturally occurring antioxidants. They have emerged as potent antioxidants suitable for incorporation into active makeup products. Recent advancements include patent filings related to novel applications and formulations of Gallic acid in cosmetic science that highlight innovative delivery systems, such as nano-formulations enhancing stability and efficacy, as well as its synergistic combinations with other active ingredients to address targeted skin concerns like pigmentation, aging, and sensitivity which meets the demands of modern consumers.",
