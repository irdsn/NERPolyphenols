  "abstract": "SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADâ€‰+)-dependent class III histone deacetylase, exhibits a high level of expression within renal tissues. It has garnered considerable recognition for its pivotal role in modulating signaling pathways intricately linked with the aging process; however, it extends beyond this in the organism. The literature reports that SIRT1 regulates biological processes such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Therefore, our study reviews the primary mechanisms by which SIRT1 induces kidney disease and the regulation of related signaling pathways in different models of renal disease. We also discuss commonly studied SIRT1-targeted interventional drugs reported in the literature, including inhibitors (e.g., Ex-527) and activators (e.g., resveratrol). This study aims to provide theoretical foundations and clinical insights for the development and screening of clinical drugs targeting SIRT1, aiming at enhanced scientific approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases.",
