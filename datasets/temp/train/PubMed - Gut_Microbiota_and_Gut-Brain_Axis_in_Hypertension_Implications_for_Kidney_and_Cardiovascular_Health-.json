  "abstract": "Arterial hypertension is a major contributor to a wide range of health complications, with cardiac hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease being among the most prevalent. Consequently, novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of hypertension are actively being explored. Recent research has highlighted a potential link between hypertension and the gut-brain axis.
