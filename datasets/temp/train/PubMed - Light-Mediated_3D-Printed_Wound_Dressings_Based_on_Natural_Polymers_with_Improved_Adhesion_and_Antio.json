  "abstract": "The lack of personalized wound dressings tailored to individual needs can significantly hinder wound healing. Hydrogels offer a promising solution, as they can be engineered to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM), providing an optimal environment for wound repair. The integration of digital light processing (DLP), a high-resolution 3D printing process, allows precise customization of hydrogel-based wound dressings. In this study, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based formulations were prepared in combination with three different polymeric precursors: methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA), poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and allyl cellulose (MCCA). These precursors were used to print high-resolution micropatterned patches. The printed constructs revealed a high gel content and a good resistance to hydrolytic degradation. To improve the adhesive and antioxidant properties of the printed patches, gallic acid (GA) was incorporated through surface functionalization. This enabled the scavenging of approximately 80% of free radicals within just 4 h. The adhesive properties of the printed wound dressings were also significantly improved, with further enhancement observed upon the addition of Fe3+ions. In vitro cytocompatibility tests using a fibroblast (NHDF) cell line confirmed the suitability of the materials for biomedical applications. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of DLP-printed hydrogels as advanced personalized wound dressing materials.",
