  "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is a critical risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, necessitating effective long-term management. However, conventional lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates are limited by adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and myopathy, which restrict their prolonged use. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and natural health products offer potential alternatives with multi-target mechanisms and improved safety profiles. Tangerine Peel Enzyme Drink (CPJS), a fermented health product derived from tangerine peel, has demonstrated lipid-modulating properties. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CPJS in improving dyslipidemia and explore its underlying metabolic and microbiological mechanisms.",
