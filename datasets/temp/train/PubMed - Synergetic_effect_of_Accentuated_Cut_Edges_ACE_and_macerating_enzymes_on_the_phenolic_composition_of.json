  "abstract": "One of the challenges of cold-hardy grape cultivars is their typical low content of tannins, alongside the presence of anthocyanin diglucoside and high acidity, which can lead to unbalanced red wines. This study hypothesized that the combination of Accentuated Cut Edges (ACE) and macerating enzymes would improve phenolics extraction from grape skins after disruption. The effects of those two winemaking techniques, either used separately or together, on red wine quality characteristics were investigated at crushing, bottling, and after six or nine months of aging. Overall, the combination of treatments improved the concentration of monomeric phenolics (20 %) and tannins (21 %) after nine months of aging. ACE or enzyme treatment separately applied had little impact on phenolics extraction in finished wines. This study exhibited a potential strategy to modify phenolics profile through the synergistic effect of ACE and macerating enzymes by causing cellular breakdown in a cold-hardy red grape cultivar.",
