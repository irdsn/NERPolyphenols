  "abstract": "Mitochondria plays a key role in the physiological function of neurons, and alteration of this organelle results in severe and irreversible cell damage. Altered mitochondrial activity usually leads to cell degeneration that compromises the function of the neuronal network. Oxidative stress represents the main critical point of this mitochondrial alteration. Research focuses on finding specific treatments for the mitochondrion to target molecules capable of acting in that specific organelle. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated a series of mitochondria-targeted compounds derived from natural phenolic acids, including caffeic, syringic, gallic and rosmarinic acid, intending to enhance their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Among these, MITO-rosmarinic was a highly effective compound, demonstrating the ability to mitigate oxidative stress-induced damage in neuronal cells. Our findings underscore the potential of MITO-rosmarinic as a candidate for preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",
