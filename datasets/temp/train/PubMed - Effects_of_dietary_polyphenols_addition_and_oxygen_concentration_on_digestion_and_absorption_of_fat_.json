  "abstract": "Reducing excessive fat intake through novel food processing methods is significant for human health. This study explored the effects of dietary polyphenol addition and oxygen concentration regulation on fat digestion and absorption in roast beef patties. Among the tested polyphenols, oligomeric proanthocyanidins from grape seeds (OPC) showed the strongest lipase inhibition. During the in vitro digestion simulation, OPC increased the particle size of oil-in-water emulsions and decreased the zeta potential, thus inhibiting the formation of fat emulsions. Spraying OPC before grilling reduced the fat digestion in beef patties. Reducing the oxygen concentration in the oven to 0Â % enhanced this effect by increasing the stability of OPC. In mice, the combination of OPC addition and oxygen regulation decreased postprandial fatty acid and triglyceride levels without changing meat fat content. This study provides an important basis for reducing the risk of obesity through food processing methods.",
