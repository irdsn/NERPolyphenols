  "abstract": "Immunosenescence, a process with a dysfunctional immune response that may favor infection is associated with an increase in inflammatory responses mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, characteristic of inflammaging. Aging and immunosenescence have a relationship relating to oxidative stress and inflammaging. Therefore, natural antioxidant compounds could be candidates for the control of the oxidative process. Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol (Resv) on the antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory responses induced by toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 4, and 7/8 agonists stimulation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of elderly and healthy female individuals (63-82 years old) and young and healthy female individuals (21-31 years old). Our data show that Resv may upregulate antioxidant factor expression, such as catalase (CAT) and SIRT1, in response to TLR4 and TLR7/8 agonists, similarly in both young and aged groups. Moreover, the Resv anti-inflammatory effect was detected by inhibiting IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 secretion levels, as well as by the chemokines CCL2 and CCL5, induced by TLR4 and TLR7/8 stimulation. Curiously, Resv decreased antiviral genes, such as MxA, STING, and IRF7 expression, possibly by reducing the inflammatory effects of interferon-induced genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of Resv to stimulate antioxidant factors, leading to a downmodulation of the inflammatory response induced by innate immune stimulation. These findings point out Resv as a strategy to control the upregulation of inflammatory response, even in elderly individuals.",
