  "abstract": "This research aimed to assess the contribution of monomeric phenols to the perception of bitterness and astringency by means of wine reconstitution experiments. Six wines with distinct total polyphenol indexes were selected and fractioned by preparative liquid chromatography into two fractions. Thirty-one reconstituted wines were prepared by combining distinct low molecular weight fractions (L) with different high molecular weight fractions (H). In-mouth attributes of reconstituted and reference wines were described by a trained sensory panel. Fractions were chemically characterized by UPLC-MS. No significant differences among sensory results were found between reference and reconstituted wines. Bitterness and astringency perception were strongly influenced by total proanthocyanidins content. Flavan-3-ol monomers and dimers were only responsible for astringency in wines with a low content of proanthocyanidins, as was the case in ros√© wine. Quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and several anthocyanins presented correlations with bitterness in the reconstituted wines; notwithstanding, several interactions with this attribute were observed.",
