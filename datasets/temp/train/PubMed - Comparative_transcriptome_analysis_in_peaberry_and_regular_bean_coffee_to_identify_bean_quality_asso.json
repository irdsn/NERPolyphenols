  "abstract": "The peaberry bean in Arabica coffee has exceptional quality compared to the regular coffee bean. Understanding the molecular mechanism of bean quality is imperative to introduce superior coffee quality traits. Despite high economic importance, the regulatory aspects of bean quality are yet largely unknown in peaberry. A transcriptome analysis was performed by using peaberry and regular coffee beans in this study.",
