  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that debilitates an overwhelming number of people in the aging population worldwide. The aggregated forms of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide play an important role in the onset of AD. Small molecules that can bind to Aβ are useful for in vitro assays, in vivo imaging, and in therapeutic research. Herein, a series of compounds that can target Aβ aggregates and inhibit their formation were developed. The interaction of several compounds with the Aβ peptide was found to modulate the formation of aggregates. These N-alkylamino stilbene compounds offer selectivity toward Aβ species against other in situ proteins and have potential for aiding the development of soluble Aβ aggregate selective AD probes.",
