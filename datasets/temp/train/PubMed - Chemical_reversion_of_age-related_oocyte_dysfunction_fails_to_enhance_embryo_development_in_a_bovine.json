  "abstract": "There are no clinical treatments to prevent/revert age-related alterations associated with oocyte competence decline in the context of advanced maternal age. Those alterations have been attributed to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that in vitro maturation (IVM) medium supplementation with antioxidants (resveratrol or phloretin) may revert age-related oocyte competence decline.",
