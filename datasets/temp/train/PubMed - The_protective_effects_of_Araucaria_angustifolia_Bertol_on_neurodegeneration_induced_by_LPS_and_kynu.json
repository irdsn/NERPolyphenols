  "abstract": "The interplay between chronic inflammation, redox imbalance, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a central key in brain disorders (BD). This study aimed to develop an in vitro model using BV-2 microglial cells treated sequentially with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and kynurenine (KYN) to mimic chronic biochemical changes observed in BD. Moreover, a polyphenol-rich extract from Araucaria angustifolia (AAE) was tested to explore a possible therapeutic intervention.",
