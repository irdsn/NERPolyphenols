  "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, requiring both pharmacological and lifestyle-based preventive strategies. Artichoke (Cynara cardunculusL. var. scolymus) has gained attention for its health benefits, including choleretic and lipid-lowering activities. However, its cardiovascular effects remain underdiscussed. This paper provides a critical review of the current literature on the cardiovascular effects of artichoke, with a focus on its underlying mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy. Experimental studies assessing artichoke's effects on endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis were assessed. Additionally, clinical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses investigating its antihypertensive effects were reviewed. Artichoke and its bioactive components, particularly flavonoids and caffeoylquinic acids, enhance endothelial-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation and inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Although clinical studies indicate improvements in flow-mediated dilation, they report only modest reductions in blood pressure, with high variability in formulations, dosages, and patient populations. While artichoke supplementation may support blood pressure regulation and endothelial health, current evidence suggests it should be considered an adjunct rather than a replacement for conventional antihypertensive therapy. Standardized formulations and well-controlled clinical studies will be required to clarify its therapeutic role.",
