  "abstract": "Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a hereditary channelopathy that affects cardiac electrical signal transmission, with SCN5A gene mutation being the most common cause. Current BrS therapy primarily relies on Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators, which are limited to arrhythmia prevention. Recent research has explored gene therapy as an alternative approach for managing BrS. Resveratrol, a non-ketone polyphenol compound, exhibits cardioprotective effects due to its antioxidant properties, which can influence gene expression through cellular signaling pathways, thereby modulating adeno-associated virus (AAV). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of resveratrol in enhancing the induction of AAV-based viral vectors as a potential definitive therapy for SCN5A mutations in BrS patients.",
