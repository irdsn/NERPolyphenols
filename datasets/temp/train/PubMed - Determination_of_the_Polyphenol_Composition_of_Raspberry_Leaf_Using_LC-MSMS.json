  "abstract": "Raspberry leaf (RL;Rubus idaeus) is a by-product of raspberry cultivation and has been proposed to be a rich source of micronutrients and potential bioactive components, including polyphenols. However, the precise chemical composition of the non-nutrient (poly)phenols in RL has not been as extensively studied.",
