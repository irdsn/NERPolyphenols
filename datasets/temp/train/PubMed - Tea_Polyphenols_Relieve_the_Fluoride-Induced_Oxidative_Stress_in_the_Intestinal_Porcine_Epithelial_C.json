  "title": "Tea Polyphenols Relieve the Fluoride-Induced Oxidative Stress in the Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cell Model.",
  "abstract": "Prolonged excessive intake of fluoride (F) can result in fluorosis, leading to a range of tissue oxidative damages. Therefore, mitigating the oxidative stress induced by fluorosis has become a significant research concern. Consequently, how to relieve oxidative stress caused by fluorosis is an urgent matter. In the present study, intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were chosen to explore the underlying mechanism of tea polyphenols (TPs) on F-induced oxidative stress. The results show that the cytotoxicity of IPEC-J2 cells induced by F presented a dose-dependent manner according to cell viability. Additionally, F treatment inhibited the activity of T-SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px as well as their transcription levels, increased the reactive oxygen (ROS) formation and cell damage rates, and then promoted cell apoptosis through the results of TUNEL and mitochondrial membrane potential detection when compared with the IPEC-J2 cells from the control group. As the main antioxidant ingredient in tea, TPs alleviated F-induced cell oxidation and apoptosis via blocking F-induced ROS generation and LDH's release, as well as promoting the transcription of tight junction (TJ) proteins and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in IPEC-J2 cells. These results provide a new treatment strategy for F-induced intestinal oxidative impairment.",
