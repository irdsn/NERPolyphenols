  "abstract": "SAMP mice develop progressive Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis without spontaneous colitis that worsens over time without chemical, genetic, or immunological manipulation. Even growing in an identical vivarium and fed with the same diet, SAMP mice reveal a distinct fecal microbiome, metabolome, and lipidome profile compared to AKR mice, their non-inflamed parental control strain. Differences are already present in 5-week-old mice, with a tendency to increase in 15-week-old mice. SAMP and AKR mice metabolome and lipidome profiles were substantially different, belonging to two clusters in line with the progression of intestinal disease. Similarly, the 16S analysis confirmed differences between 15-week-old AKR and SAMP mice. The protective role of dietary polyphenols has been documented in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD); thus, we supplemented the chow diet with an anthocyanin-rich extract (RED) to evaluate disease reduction in SAMP mice and changes in fecal microbiota/metabolome. Our data reveal that 10-week supplementation with anthocyanin-rich extract ameliorated disease severity in SAMP mice despite limited fecal microbiota/metabolome differences.",
