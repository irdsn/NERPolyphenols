  "abstract": "In this research, chlorogenic acid (CA) and corbicula fluminea protein hydrolysates (CFP) were physically mixed to simulate practical scenarios. The non-covalent complexes were detected in the system. The underlying mechanisms as well as their effects on the antioxidant properties and bioaccessibility of CFP were detailed investigated. For better comparison, CA covalent with CFP complexes were also fabricated. Overall, CA-CFP predominantly formed loose structural complexes through non-covalent interactions, whereas covalent interactions resulted in more compact conjunctions. The antioxidant activity of CFP was significantly enhanced following interaction with CA, whether through non-covalent or covalent means. Notably, the non-covalent complexes exhibited superior antioxidant capacity and demonstrated synergistic antioxidant effects. Furthermore, the incorporation of CA into CFP improved the bioaccessibility and gastrointestinal digestive antioxidant activity of CFP, with the beneficial effects being more pronounced in the non-covalent complexes. The bounded CA may be responsible for these changes through partially inhibiting the hydrolysis of CFP.",
