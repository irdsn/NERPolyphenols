  "abstract": "(Poly)phenols are bioactive compounds widely distributed in plant-based foods. Currently, limited data exist on the intake distribution of (poly)phenols across meals. This study aimed to estimate dietary intakes of all individual (poly)phenols and total intake per class and subclass by meal event, and to identify their main food sources in the subcohort MAX from the Diet, Cancer and Health-Next Generations cohort (DCH-NG).",
