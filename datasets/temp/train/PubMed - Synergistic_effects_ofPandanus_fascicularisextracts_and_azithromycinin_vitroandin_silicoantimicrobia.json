  "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming a significant global concern. To combat the spread of resistance or reverse multidrug resistance, developing novel antimicrobials and/or resistance modulators is essential. This study aimed to evaluate the synergistic effects of the methanolic extract ofPandanus fascicularisfruits (MEPFF) in combination with azithromycin against multidrug-resistant bacteria.",
