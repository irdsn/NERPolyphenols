  "title": "Fraction K3 From Moringa oleifera Exhibits Gastroprotective Effects Through Inhibitory Activity Against Helicobacter pylori and Gastric Acid Secretion.",
  "abstract": "The gastroprotective effects of the fractions of ethanol extract of Moringa oleifera leaves (MOEE) were examined. Gastric antisecretory effect and antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori were used as indices of gastroprotection. MOEE was fractionated to yield five major fractions (K1-K5). Preliminary quantitative phytochemical analysis was carried out on the fractions using standard methods. A total of 40 rats were selected through randomization into eight different groups for the antisecretory activity screening, each group consists of five rats. Groups 1, 2, and 8 served as normal, negative, and positive controls, respectively, whereas Groups 3-7 were administered histamine and 200 mg/kg of K1-K5, respectively. Gastric acid output was then measured. For the antimicrobial study, the fractions were tested for activity against 10 different strains of H. pylori using in vitro agar diffusion assay. Results revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds in varying proportions. The fraction K3 had a significant decrease in histamine-induced gastric acid secretion at p > 0.05. K3 was also the most active against the different strains of H. pylori. It was concluded that the ethanol extract of M. oleifera leaves possesses gastroprotective effects as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit gastric acid hypersecretion and H. pylori activity. It is also safe to say that the active principles of M. oleifera leaves are present in K3.",
