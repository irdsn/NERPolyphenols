  "abstract": "Elaeagnus umbellata is known for its medicinal properties, including its ability to promote wound healing and exhibit antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, methanolic leaf and bark extract (MLE and MBE) of E. umbellata was tested for total phenol and flavonoid content and evaluated for antioxidant activity. FTIR and GC-MS analysis were followed by an in silico study of bioactive constituents for their role in inhibiting advanced glycation end-products (RAGEs) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptors. Both extracts demonstrated significant antioxidant activity, with MLE showing stronger activity than MBE. The FTIR spectra for functional groups confirmed a diverse range of metabolites. The GC-MS analysis showed 41 bioactive compounds exhibiting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic activities. The docking analysis of selected compounds with RAGE and GLP1 receptors revealed variations in binding affinities, pKi values, and ligand efficiencies. E. umbellata contains a significant amount of phytochemicals exhibiting strong antioxidant activity. The activity of phenols and flavonoids suggests that they can be used as a source of natural antioxidants. Molecular docking analysis indicates that various compounds have the potential to act as effective inhibitors of RAGE and GLP, thereby modulating proinflammatory responses and mitigating oxidative damage in the cellular pathways.",
