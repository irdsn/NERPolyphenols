  "abstract": "The use ofArtemisiaspecies' plant extracts and essential oils, which are rich in bioactive compounds (allelochemicals), could support weed management. This study focused on the chemical analysis and evaluation of the allelopathic potential of plant extracts (PEs) and essential oils (EOs) ofArtemisia absinthiumandA. vulgarison the germination and early seedling growth of weeds (Amaranthus retroflexusandSetaria viridis)in vitro. The plant extract fromA. vulgarisshowed higher antioxidant activity (IC50= 0.171 ± 0.01 mg/mL) and phenolic content than that fromA. absinthium(IC50= 0.263 ± 0.01 mg/mL). Chlorogenic acid was the most abundant phenol in both extracts. However,A. absinthiumcontained a higher amount (1.694 ± 0.081 mg/g) and exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on the germination ofA. retroflexus(EC50= 0.54 ± 0.02%) andS. viridis(EC50= 1.51 ± 0.07%) compared toA. vulgaris. The dominant components ofA. absinthiumessential oil were β-thujone (18.9%), cis-ocimene epoxide (7.88%), and bicyclogermacrene (7.04%), while the main constituents ofA. vulgarisessential oil included gurjunene (10.41%), cis-crysanthenyl acetate (7.17%), and γ-humulene (6.67%). The lowest EC50values forA. absinthiumessential oil regarding seed germination and seedling length were estimated forS. viridis(0.28 ± 0.48% and 0.03 ± 0.00%, respectively), whereasA. retroflexuswas the most sensitive toA. vulgarisessential oil (0.11 ± 0.04% and 0.02 ± 0.00%, respectively). All tested extracts showed allelopathic potential; however, the results indicate that the essential oils had a stronger inhibitory effect than the plant extracts.",
