  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide health challenge and imposes a considerable strain on healthcare systems. By 2035, it is anticipated that around 592 million adults will be impacted by diabetes as a result of causes like aging, rapid population expansion, urbanization, obesity, lifestyle modifications, and heightened intake of calorie-dense, fatty, and fast meals. Despite the availability of several pharmaceutical therapies, they often come with higher expenses and adverse side effects, making them inaccessible to a large portion of the population. Bioactive compounds, especially flavonoids, are emerging as potential alternatives for diabetes management. Flavonoids, a category of polyphenolic chemicals included in fruits, vegetables, and various plant- derived foods, provide numerous therapeutic advantages. In addition to their glucose-lowering benefits, they increase antioxidant defence, improve insulin efficacy, and diminish the risk of cardiovascular problems. The clinical application of flavonoids is hindered by issues like poor solubility, low bioavailability, and complicated metabolism. This review explores the integration of nanotechnology- based delivery technologies to address these limitations. Advanced nano-formulations, such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, and solid lipid nanoparticles, improve the solubility, stability, and absorption of flavonoids while facilitating targeted delivery and prolonged therapeutic benefits. The review highlights the efficacy of flavonoid-based nano-formulations in efficiently managing diabetes mellitus and its related problems. Moreover, it highlights the need for ongoing research to enhance these formulations and explore the molecular pathways that underlie their antidiabetic efficacy. This approach demonstrates the significance of nanotechnology in transforming diabetes care and enhancing patient outcomes.",
