  "abstract": "In this study, the influences of inorganic nitrogen source (INS) and organic nitrogen source (ONS) supplementation during the wine fermentation process using three non-Saccharomyces yeasts (Candida zemplinina,Candida oleophila, andCandida boidinii) were analyzed. Diamine phosphate (DAP) was used as an INS, and lees enzymatic hydrolysate was used as an ONS. Complete alcoholic fermentation and a higher concentration of volatile compounds were obtained in fermentations with ONS, mainly esters from 81 to 4564 µg/L, alcohols from 231 to 7294 µg/L, and isoamyl acetate ester compounds from 12.3-22.8 ppb, with a very marked odorant activity value (OAV). In addition, malic acid was detected due to its influence on yeast metabolism and, consequently, on aroma production. Using a Y15 enzymatic autoanalyzer, residues of 1.30 g/L in ONS and 1.35 g/L in INS were obtained on the last day of alcoholic fermentation. In summary, we obtained promising results concerning the production of wine with enhanced functionalities due to higher concentrations of some volatile and polyphenolic compounds.",
