  "abstract": "Cruciferous vegetables (CV) are a source of dietary fiber and phytochemicals that alter the microbiome in animals and humans. Constituent CV compounds, such as glucosinolates, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in animal models, though often using doses and basal diets that are not relevant to humans. The mechanism(s) are unclear, but the gut microbiota may metabolize these compounds into bioactive molecules that influence immune pathways.",
