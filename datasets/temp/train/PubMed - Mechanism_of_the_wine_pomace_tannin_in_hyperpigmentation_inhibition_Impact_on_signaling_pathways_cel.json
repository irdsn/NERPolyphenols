  "title": "Mechanism of the wine pomace tannin in hyperpigmentation inhibition: Impact on signaling pathways, cell proliferation, and tyrosinase activity.",
  "abstract": "After winemaking, tannins with high polymerization remain in the pomace. Utilizing these tannin fractions is a concern for the wine industry. While tannins show potential in treating hyperpigmentation, their mechanisms in vivo and at the cellular level are unclear. Herein, pomace tannin fractions (PTFs) were isolated post-winemaking. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analysis showed PTFs were composed of (epi)catechin gallate and (epi)catechin as terminal and extensional units, with polymerization degrees of 10, 16, and 35. In vivo studies demonstrated that PTFs removed ∼76 % of skin melanin, comparable to hydroquinone. The inhibition by PTFs is due to: (1) Inhibition of the Wnt and melanogenesis pathways, downregulating key melanin synthesis proteins (TYR, TYRP1, TYRP2); (2) Inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint, disrupting DNA, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and integrity, and slowing melanocyte proliferation; (3) Superior tyrosinase inhibitory activity by binding to tyrosinase, chelating copper ions, and demonstrating antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that PTFs inhibit melanin synthesis by the combination of the above mentioned ways, supporting the medical use of winemaking tannins.",
