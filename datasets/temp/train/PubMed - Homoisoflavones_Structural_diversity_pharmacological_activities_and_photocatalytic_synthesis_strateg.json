  "abstract": "Homoisoflavones, a rare subclass of flavonoids distinguished from isoflavones by an additional carbon atom in their parent structure, have garnered attention for their significant pharmacological properties. Firstly, this review methodically analyzes the structural diversity of all documented homoisoflavone variants and their pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and other biological effects, based on studies spanning from 1973 to the latest accessible data (March 2025). Secondly, the photo-induced synthesis methodologies for homoisoflavones are meticulously scrutinized and elaborated upon, compared with traditional synthetic approaches, as photo-mediated organic synthesis strategy continue to gain prominence as a valuable tool in medicinal chemistry. Finally, based on the structural features, pharmacological activities, and photo-induced synthesis strategies of homoisoflavones, potential future development prospects are proposed. For the first time, this article analyzes the medicinal chemistry potential of homoisoflavones from the perspective of photocatalysis, highlighting their structural features, pharmacological activities, and innovative synthesis strategies. It is hoped that this review will provide valuable guidance for the development of homoisoflavones in medicinal chemistry.",
