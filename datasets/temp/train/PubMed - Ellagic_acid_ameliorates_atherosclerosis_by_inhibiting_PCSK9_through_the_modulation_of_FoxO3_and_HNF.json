  "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) hinders the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by promoting the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), leading to the accumulation of LDL-C and thus becoming an important cause of atherosclerosis. Ellagic acid, a naturally occurring polyphenol widely present in fruits, vegetables, and nuts, has attracted significant attention due to its potential role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ellagic acid alleviates atherosclerosis by inhibiting PCSK9 are not fully understood.",
