  "abstract": "Olive mill wastewater (OMW) poses a significant environmental challenge and health concern in olive-producing countries, including Jordan. Surfactant micelles are frequently employed as solubilizing agents to enhance the water solubility of chemical compounds. This study aims to leverage the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles in a multi-step process to detoxify OMW for agricultural and industrial uses and reduce its impact. The OMW was treated in multiple steps: screening, coagulation with different chemicals, and distillation with different surfactants. The treatment steps were monitored using LC-MS, GC-MS, ICP-MS, chemical oxygen demand contents, and total phenolic compounds. The detoxification of OMW was evaluated using standard germination assays, MTT assays using tissue culture, and toxicity assays using fluorescence bacteria. Following the treatment, the seed growth rate improved significantly from 0% to 100%. The GC-MS revealed a substantial decrease in pollutants. The concentration of polyphenols was reduced to 2.5%, while the COD level decreased to 35%. The toxicity in bacteria was significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner, and the toxicity in human cells decreased by 95%. Additionally, between 50% and 95% of metals in OMW were removed. The multi-step SDS-based approach successfully detoxified the OMW and enhanced water quality, which would pave the road for its direct application in industry and agriculture.",
