  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction, resulting in hyperglycemia. Olive oil, a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet, has attracted considerable attention due to its potential health benefits, including reducing the risk of developing T2DM. This literature review aims to critically examine and synthesize existing research regarding the impact of olive oil on the expression of genes relevant to T2DM. This paper also seeks to provide an immunological and genetic perspective on the signaling pathways of the main components of extra virgin olive oil. Key bioactive components of olive oil, such as oleic acid and phenolic compounds, were identified as modulators of insulin signaling. These compounds enhanced the insulin signaling pathway, improved lipid metabolism, and reduced oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally, they were shown to alleviate inflammation by inhibiting the NF-ÎºB pathway and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Furthermore, these bioactive compounds were observed to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by downregulating stress markers, thereby protecting beta cells from apoptosis and preserving their function. In summary, olive oil, particularly its bioactive constituents, has been demonstrated to enhance insulin sensitivity, protect beta cell function, and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress by modulating key genes involved in these processes. These findings underscore olive oil's therapeutic potential in managing T2DM. However, further research, including well-designed human clinical trials, is required to fully elucidate the role of olive oil in personalized nutrition strategies for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.",
