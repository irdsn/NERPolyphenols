  "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and patients with distant metastasis have a poor prognosis. Various studies have reported that microbiota and metabolites significantly differ between healthy individuals and lung cancer patients. However, the effects of metabolites on tumor formation and metastasis are unclear. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the correlation between airway metabolites and microbiota, along with their respective roles in lung cancer metastasis.",
