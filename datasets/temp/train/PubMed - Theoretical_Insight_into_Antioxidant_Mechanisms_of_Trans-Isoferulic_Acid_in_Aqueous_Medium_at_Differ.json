  "abstract": "This study presents the first comprehensive theoretical investigation of the antioxidant mechanisms of trans-isoferulic acid against hydroperoxyl (HOOâ€¢) radicals in aqueous solution, using the DFT/M062X/6-311+G(d,p)/PCM method. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, including reaction energy barriers and bimolecular rate constants, were determined for the three major pathways: hydrogen transfer (HT), radical adduct formation (RAF), and single electron transfer (SET). The results indicate that, at physiological pH, the RAF mechanism is both more exergonic and approximately eight-times faster than HT. At a higher pH, where the phenolate anion dominates, antioxidant activity is enhanced by an additional fast, diffusion-limited SET pathway. Isoferulic acid was also found to effectively chelate Fe2+ions at pH 7.4 and above, forming stable complexes that could inhibit Fenton-type hydroxyl radical generation. Moreover, its strong UV absorption suggests a role in limiting photo-induced free radical formation. These findings not only clarify the antioxidant behavior of isoferulic acid but also provide novel theoretical insights applicable to related phenolic compounds. The compound's multi-target antioxidant profile highlights its potential as a photoprotective agent in sunscreen formulations.",
