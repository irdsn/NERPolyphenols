  "abstract": "Utilizing renewable biological resources is an ecofriendly and sustainable approach as it minimizes the use of toxic chemicals and their environmental impact. In this study, stable silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized using a low-cost, eco-friendly, photo-induced method. The cellular extract of Bacillus safensis strain U17-1 bacteria served as a reducing agent. Characterization of the biosynthesized AgNPs was conducted via scanning electron microscopy, confirming their spherical morphology, and EDS analysis conducted at 3 keV revealed the presence of silver. FTIR analysis identified various functional groups present on the surface of nanoparticles. The biosynthesized AgNPs had an average diameter of 133 nm, with a zeta potential of - 22.3 mV, establishing their stable, nanoparticulate nature. These biosynthesized AgNPs were utilized as nano-elicitors, and their elicitation effect was observed on the growth and phytochemical content of hydroponically grown Fenugreek plants. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in the following parameters: shoot height, fresh weight, dry weight, proteins, carbohydrates, phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins across various concentrations. These findings suggest the potential utility of biosynthesized AgNPs as elicitors for enhancing plant growth and phytochemical content, emphasizing their cost-effectiveness, and promising applications for sustainable agricultural practices.",
