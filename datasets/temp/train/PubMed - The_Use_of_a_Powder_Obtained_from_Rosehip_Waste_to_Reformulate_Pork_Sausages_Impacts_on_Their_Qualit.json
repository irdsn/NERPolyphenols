  "title": "The Use of a Powder Obtained from Rosehip Waste to Reformulate Pork Sausages: Impacts on Their Quality.",
  "abstract": "The powder obtained from rosehip waste can be used as an ingredient in meat products because it contains polyphenolic compounds with preservative and antioxidant effects and carotenoid compounds with a colouring effect. This study aimed to evaluate how partially replacing raw meat with this powder impacts the quality of pork sausages. Therefore, three sausage formulations (PSc-control pork sausages; PS2.7%rp-pork sausages with 2.7% powder from rosehip waste; PS5.5%rp-pork sausages with 5.5% powder from rosehip waste) were prepared and evaluated during storage from physicochemical, colour, texture, and sensory points of view, as well as for their polyphenol and carotenoid contents. The use of the powder from rosehip waste as an ingredient in pork sausages resulted in a significant decrease in moisture and protein content but an increase in total carbohydrates, polyphenols, and carotenoids; additionally, it significantly decreased the pH and easily hydrolysable nitrogen content of sausages, thus demonstrating a preservative effect. It also positively influenced their colour (by intensifying the shades of red and yellow), as well as the sausages' gumminess and chewiness (by reducing them). Although it slightly affected their taste and texture, the consumer acceptance rate for reformulated sausages was reasonable. In conclusion, the powder obtained from rosehip waste is a promising functional ingredient in pork sausage reformulation.",
