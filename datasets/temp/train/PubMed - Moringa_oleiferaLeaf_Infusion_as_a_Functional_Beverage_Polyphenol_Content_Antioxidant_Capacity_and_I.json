  "abstract": "Moringa oleifera(MO) leaf infusion has gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects, particularly in metabolic health, due to its rich content of bioactive compounds, including polyphenols. The study evaluates the antioxidant properties and metabolic effects of the prophylactic administration of MO infusion in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced murine model. First, polyphenol content (0.45 mg/g) and antioxidant activity (45.39%) were determined using Folin-Ciocalteu, DPPH, phosphomolybdenum, ferrocyanide, and anti-browning assays. In the in vivo phase, BALB/c mice were divided into three groups: a balanced diet group, a negative control group, and an HFD group supplemented with MO infusion. Over eight months, biochemical analyses, psychomotor tests, glucose tolerance assessments, and liver histopathology were conducted. MO infusion significantly reduced food intake, weight gain, lipid profiles, and liver inflammation compared to the negative control group, while promoting a metabolic profile similar to that of the balanced diet group. Additionally, it positively influenced psychomotor performance, reinforcing its neuroactive potential. These findings suggest that MO leaf infusion may serve as a functional beverage with protective effects against metabolic disorders, offering a promising natural strategy for managing obesity-related health issues.",
