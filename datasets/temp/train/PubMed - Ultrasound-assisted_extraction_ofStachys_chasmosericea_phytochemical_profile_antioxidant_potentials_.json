  "abstract": "Understanding the bioactive potential of plant extracts requires detailed evaluations of their chemical composition and bioactivities. This study investigated the chemical profiles, antioxidant properties, and enzyme inhibitory activities of water and methanol extracts ofStachys chasmosericeaAyasligil & P.H.Davis obtained via ultrasound-assisted extraction. The methanol extract displayed significantly higher total phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to the water extract. Chromatographic analysis revealed verbascoside and chlorogenic acid as the dominant compounds in the methanol extract, whereas the water extract contained higher levels of polar compounds likep-coumaric acid. Antioxidant assays demonstrated the methanol extract's superior activity. Conversely, the water extract excelled in metal chelation. RACI values confirmed the methanol extract's overall antioxidant superiority (RACI = 0.65) over the water extract (RACI = -0.65). Enzyme inhibition assays revealed the methanol extract's stronger activity against AChE, BChE, α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and tyrosinase whereas the water extract showed weaker inhibition. Both extracts demonstrated potential for managing oxidative stress and enzyme-related disorders but require further in vivo validation. This study highlightsS. chasmosericea, particularly its methanol extract, as a promising source of natural antioxidants and enzyme inhibitors. Future research should focus on isolating individual bioactives and exploring their mechanisms of action in biological systems.",
