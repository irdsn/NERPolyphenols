  "abstract": "Ptaeroxylon obliquum(Thunb.) Radlk. (Rutaceae) is traditionally used for a range of purposes, including ethnoveterinary medicine and to treat various human ailments such as tuberculosis, inflammatory diseases, and bacterial and fungal infections. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the traditional uses, phytochemistry, toxicology, in silico, and pharmacological activities ofP. obliquumand discuss the advances made to date. The phytochemistry ofP. obliquumrevealed the abundance of secondary metabolites such as coumarins and chromones, essential oils, and several other classes of bioactive compounds. A total of 80 secondary metabolites have been reported from this plant species. In vitro studies onP. obliquumexplored its therapeutic potential and reported pharmacological properties such as antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, antimycobacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative activities. This review highlights the diversity of the medicinal use ofP. obliquumand encourages its preservation. Future research should focus on the efficacy ofP. obliquum'smost promising bioactive compounds, and the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) pharmacological activities may help determine therapeutic potential in in vivo animal models and validate the wide range of traditional uses ofP. obliquum.",
