  "abstract": "Peutz-Jeghers (PJ) syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by the association of intestinal polyposis, mucosal skin pigmentation, and cancer susceptibility. PJS patients have a significantly increased risk of malignant tumors in the gastrointestinal tract and extra-gastrointestinal tract, including various epithelial malignant tumors (colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer,etc.). PJS is commonly seen in children and adolescents with multiple small intestinal polyps, often causing intussusception.",
