  "abstract": "Protein-based foams are potential sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based polymer foams in e.g. single-use products. In this work, the biodegradation, bioassimilation, and recycling properties of glycerol-plasticized wheat gluten foams (using a foaming agent and gallic acid, citric acid, or genipin) were determined. The degradation was investigated at different pH levels in soil and high humidity. The fastest degradation occurred in an aqueous alkaline condition with complete degradation within 5 weeks. The foams exhibited excellent bioassimilation, comparable to or better than industrial fertilizers, particularly in promoting coriander plant growth. The additives provided specific effects: gallic acid offered antifungal properties, citric acid provided the fastest degradation at high pH, and genipin contributed with cross-linking. All three additives also contributed to antioxidant properties. Dense β-sheet protein structures degraded more slowly than disordered/α-helix structures. WG foams showed only a small global warming potential and lower fossil carbon emissions than synthetic foams on a mass basis, as illustrated with a nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) foam. Unlike NBR, the protein foams could be recycled into films, offering an alternative to immediate composting.",
