  "abstract": "A new lignan (1) and a new phenolic glycoside (2), together with eighteen known compounds (3-20), were isolated fromOxytropis ochrocephala. Their structures were unambiguously elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, 1D and 2D NMR), and HR-ESI-MS analysis, as well as by comparison with the literature. The insecticidal activity of these compounds was evaluated againstTetranychus urticaeKoch, and the results showed that compounds3,9,15, and16had a weak inhibitory effect at a concentration of 1 mg/mL after treatment for 24 h.",
