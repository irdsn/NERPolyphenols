  "abstract": "Flavonoids are largely present in plant food such as cocoa and derived products. These compounds can interact with proteins inherently contained in the food matrix and/or the proteolytic enzymes involved in gastrointestinal digestion. The flavonoid/protein interaction might hamper protein bioaccessibility and digestibility, affecting the nutritional quality. However, information on the digestion fate of proteins in food matrices containing both proteins and flavonoids is limited. The aim of this work was to evaluate the interaction between proteins and flavonoids and verify the potential effects of this interaction on protein digestibility. Taking milk chocolate as model, first a simple whey proteins/catechins mixed system was evaluated, and then the effects on digestibility were also verified in a real sample of commercial milk chocolate. The effects of the catechins/whey proteins interaction in the model system were evaluated by optical and chiro-optical spectroscopy, outlining a slight protein structure modification upon interaction with catechins. The digestibility of the protein fraction both in the model system, with and without catechins, and also in milk chocolate, was then determined by the application of INFOGEST in vitro digestion method: the bioaccessibility was evaluated in terms of protein hydrolysis and protein solubilisation, and major peptides generated by the digestion were also determined by LC/HR-MS. Despite the slight interaction with proteins, flavonoids were found to not hinder nor modify protein solubilization, protein hydrolysis and peptide profile by digestive enzymes. Also protein digestibility in milk chocolate, evaluated by SDS-PAGE, was found to be complete. The present data clearly indicate that the interaction of the proteins with the flavonoids present in the cocoa matrix does not to affect protein bioaccessibility during digestion.",
