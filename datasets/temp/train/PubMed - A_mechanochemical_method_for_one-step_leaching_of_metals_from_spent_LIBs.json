  "abstract": "A one-step system based on mechanochemical activation and the use of grape skins (GS) was proposed to recover metals from lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) cathode waste. The effects of the ball-milling (BM) speed, BM time, and quantity of added GS on the metal leaching rate were explored. The spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) and its leaching residue before and after mechanochemistry were characterized by SEM, BET, PSD, XRD, FT-IR, and XPS analysis. Our study shows that mechanochemistry promotes the leaching efficiency of metals from LIBs battery cathode waste by changing the cathode material properties (that is, reducing the LCO particle size (12.126 μm ∼ 0.0928 μm), increasing the specific surface area (0.123 m2/g ∼ 15.957 m2/g), enhancing the hydrophilicity and surface free energy (57.44 mN/m2∼ 66.18 mN/m2), promoting the generation of mesoporous structures, refining grains, disrupting the crystal structure, and increasing the microscopic strain, while deflecting the binding energy of the metal ions). A green, efficient and environmentally friendly process for the harmless and resource-friendly treatment of spent LIBs has been developed in this study.",
