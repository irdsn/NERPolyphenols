  "abstract": "Browning is the key problem hindering the industrialization of pear wine. The use of high-yield glutathione Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the fermentation of pear wine can inhibit browning. Glutathione reductase (GR) can ensure the reduction of glutathione. Spore immobilization of enzymes is a new technology. It is a new attempt to apply spore-immobilized GR in combination with high-yield glutathione S. cerevisiae to inhibit browning of pear wine.",
