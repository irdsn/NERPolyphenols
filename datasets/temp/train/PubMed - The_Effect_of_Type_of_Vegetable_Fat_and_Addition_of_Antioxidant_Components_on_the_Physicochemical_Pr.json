  "abstract": "In recent years, interest in functional foods and meat analogues has increased. This study investigated the effect of the type of vegetable fat and ingredients with antioxidant activity on the properties of a meat analogue based on textured pea protein. The possibility of using acai oil (AO), canola oil (CO) and olive oil (OO); propolis extract (P); buckwheat honey (H); and jalapeno pepper extract (JE) was investigated. The texture, colour and selected chemical parameters of plant-based burgers were analysed. Results showed that burgers from control group had the lowest hardness, while burgers with honey had the highest. The highest MUFA content was found in samples with olive oil. Samples with honey were characterised by the highest content of polyphenols, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. The highest overall acceptability was observed in burgers from the JE-CO group. Therefore, it is possible to use selected ingredients with antioxidant activity in the recipe for a plant-based burger with high product acceptability.",
