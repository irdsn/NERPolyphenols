  "title": "Unraveling the therapeutic mechanisms of Bufei Yiqi decoction in pulmonary fibrosis: Modulation of autophagy and glycolysis pathways.",
  "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease marked by excessive collagen deposition and inflammation. Bufei Yiqi Decoction (BFYQD), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has shown potential in treating PF, but its mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore BFYQD's therapeutic effects on PF, focusing on its regulation of glycolysis and autophagy via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway, providing a foundation for its clinical application. A PF mouse model was established using bleomycin (BLM). Nontargeted metabolomics, network pharmacology, and transcriptomics were integrated to identify dysregulated pathways. Molecular docking assessed binding affinities between BFYQD compounds and targets. Western blot, biochemical assays, and histopathological staining validated findings. Serum metabolomics identified bioactive compounds. Multi-omics analysis revealed PI3K/Akt as a key regulator of glycolysis in PF. Quercetin, kaempferol, and glabridin were identified as bioactive compounds in BFYQD, showing strong binding to PI3K/Akt pathway proteins. BFYQD suppressed PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and HIF-1Î± phosphorylation, reducing glycolysis and enhancing autophagy. Histopathological analysis confirmed reduced fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). BFYQD alleviates PF by modulating glycolysis and autophagy via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Its bioactive compounds, such as quercetin and kaempferol, offer a novel therapeutic strategy for PF.",
