  "abstract": "To develop a multifunctional curcumin-based self-assembled nanomedicine for antibacterial purposes and to provide substantial support for the development of novel multifunctional antibacterial agents, thereby mitigating the challenges posed by bacterial infections. Self-assembled curcumin nanoparticles (Cur NPs) were synthesized via solvent evaporation. Caffeic acid (CA) and iron ions were then reacted under mildly alkaline conditions (pH 8.0) to form metal-phenolic networks (MPNs), which were coated onto the Cur NPs (Cur@MPN). Efficient antibacterial performance is achieved by multifunctional Cur@MPN through spatiotemporally synergistic integration of photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy, and drug treatment. The results obtained from TEM, UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and XPS confirmed the successful preparation of a multifunctional nano-antibacterial material, Cur@MPN, by modifying Cur NPs with MPNs through a coordination reaction between CA and iron ions. Cur@MPN exhibited excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (64.1%), pH-dependent hydroxyl radical (·OH) generation, and glutathione consumption. The minimum inhibitory concentration of Cur@MPN againstS. aureusandE. coliwas 100μg ml-1and 120μg ml-1, respectively, under the synergistic effect of multiple modalities.In vivostudies suggested that Cur@MPN accelerates wound healing by promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition. These findings suggest that Cur@MPN is a promising innovative multifunctional self-assembled nanomaterial with considerable potential for antibacterial therapy and wound healing.",
