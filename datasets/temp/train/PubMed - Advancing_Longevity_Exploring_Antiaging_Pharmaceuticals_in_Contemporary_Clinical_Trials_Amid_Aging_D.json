  "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable biological process that significantly impacts human health, leading to a decline in cellular function and an increase in cellular damage. This study elucidates the burgeoning potential of antiaging pharmaceuticals in mitigating the thriving burden of chronic conditions linked to advancing age. It underscores the pivotal role of these pharmacotherapeutic agents in fostering longevity free from debilitating age-related afflictions, notably cardiovascular disorders, neoplastic processes, and neurodegenerative pathologies. While commendable strides have been made evident in preclinical models, it is crucial to thoroughly investigate their effectiveness and safety in human groups. In addition, ethical concerns about fair access, societal impacts, and careful resource distribution are significant in discussions about developing and using antiaging medications. By approaching the development and utilization of antiaging medications with diligence and foresight, we can strive toward a future where individuals can enjoy extended lifespans free from the debilitating effects of age-related ailments.",
