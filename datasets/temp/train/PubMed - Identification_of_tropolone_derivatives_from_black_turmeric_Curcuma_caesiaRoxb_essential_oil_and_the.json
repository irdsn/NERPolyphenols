  "abstract": "The present study focused on the identification of tropolone derivatives in the essential oils of black turmeric (Curcuma caesiaRoxb.). Cyclohepta[b]furan-2-ones and azulene compounds to which tropolone might be the precursor were detected in the essential oils. Predominant compounds present were curzerenone (51.11-70.26%), curzerene (1.85-3.62%), germacrone (3.64-12.54%) and eremanthin (3.9-5.08%). The efficacy of extracted essential oil (BTC) and tropolone (TC) on postharvest quality of edible coated mangoes was studied during storage at 28 ± 2 °C (RT) and 9 ± 2 °C (LT). Treated mangoes showed lower water loss and higher firmness than control mangoes at both temperatures. β-carotene and sugar content increased in the mangoes stored at RT indicating ripening with higher TSS (Total Soluble Solids) and lower acidity (p< 0.05). Phenolic and flavonoid concentration was retained in the coated mangoes at LT. The study concluded that the BTC and TC mangoes at LT extended the shelf life with delayed ripening.",
