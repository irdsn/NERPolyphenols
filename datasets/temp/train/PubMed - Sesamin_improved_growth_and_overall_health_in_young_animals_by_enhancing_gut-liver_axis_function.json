  "title": "Sesamin improved growth and overall health in young animals by enhancing gut-liver axis function.",
  "abstract": "The immature gastrointestinal development of infants and young animals made them more vulnerable to stress-related damage, which affected the gut-liver axis and consequently impaired their health and growth. This study used weaned piglets as a model to investigate how dietary sesamin regulated the gut-liver axis and impacted young animal health. We assessed gut-liver tissue morphology, measured key indicators of intestinal barrier damage, mucosal repair, antioxidant and immune pathways in the gut-liver system and serum, and analyzed microbial composition. We further explored the interactions between sesamin and the gut-liver axis through PLS-PM and molecular docking analysis. Results showed that sesamin enhanced intestinal barrier function, reduced liver damage, decreased oxidative stress, promoted anti-inflammatory immune responses, and enriched beneficial microbes, thereby promoting overall growth. Sesamin can enhance the health of young animals by regulating the function of the gut-liver axis.",
