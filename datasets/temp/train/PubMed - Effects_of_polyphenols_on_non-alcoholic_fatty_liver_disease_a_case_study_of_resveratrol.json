  "title": "Effects of polyphenols on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a case study of resveratrol.",
  "abstract": "The primary etiology of liver disease is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The efficacy of plant-derived polyphenolic compounds has been extensively demonstrated with respect to various aspects and recently proved to be effective at preventing and treating NAFLD. To describe the sources and functions of polyphenolic constituents and clarify the therapeutic effects of polyphenolic constituents on NAFLD, resveratrol (RSV), which has significant therapeutic effects, was selected for a comprehensive analysis. Bibliometric and network pharmacology analyses revealed a strong correlation between insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress, steatosis, and NAFLD, as well as the significance of intestinal flora and therapeutic interventions for NAFLD. This study reviewed the mechanisms by which RSV acted against NAFLD and explored techniques to enhance its bioavailability. These findings offer new insights into the treatment of NAFLD and the development of innovative RSV formulations.",
