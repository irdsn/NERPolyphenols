  "abstract": "Cowpea is an important dry bean in developing countries, and its young leaves and green pods are consumed as fresh vegetables. Consuming green pods provides vitamins, minerals, and functional components for small-scale farmers with limited access to vegetables. However, the accumulation process of functional components in young cowpea pods is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the concentrations of folic acid, phenolic components, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in green pods throughout maturity to determine the accumulation process of functional components.",
