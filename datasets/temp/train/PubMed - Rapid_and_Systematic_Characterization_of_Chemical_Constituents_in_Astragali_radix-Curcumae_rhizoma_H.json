  "abstract": "Astragali radix-Curcumae rhizoma (AC), a traditional Chinese herb pair, has been extensively used in clinical practice for the treatment of various types of cancer. However, there is a paucity of literature that comprehensively elucidates the chemical constituents of AC. The complex composition of AC remains poorly understood, with many constituents yet to be fully distinguished. Therefore, a strategy was established for identifying and characterizing the chemical constituents of AC based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). Furthermore, the exploratory quantitative analysis was conducted on its representative compounds using a calibration curve method. The results showed that a total of 140 compounds were identified, including 40 flavonoids, 50 sesquiterpenes, 15 amino acids, 13 saponins, 6 organic acids, 4 curcumins, 4 nucleosides, and 8 other compounds. Among the 24 compounds determined, calycosin-7-glucoside was found to have the highest content. In conclusion, this study has developed a reliable qualitative strategy and an exploratory quantitative method and systematically characterized the chemical constituents in AC, which lays a solid foundation for quality control of AC, as well as for the further screening of potential effective constituents.",
