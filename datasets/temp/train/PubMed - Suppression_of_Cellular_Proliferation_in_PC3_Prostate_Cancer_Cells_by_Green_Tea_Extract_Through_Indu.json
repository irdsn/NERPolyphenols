  "title": "Suppression of Cellular Proliferation in PC3 Prostate Cancer Cells by Green Tea Extract Through Induction of miR-34a Expression.",
  "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) ranks as the fifth major cause of cancer-related fatalities globally. Exploring new methods with high efficacy and low side effects by using new compounds is always desired. Tea is considered the second most commonly consumed beverage among the population of the world. Polyphenols (or catechins) in green tea play a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. Herein, we evaluate the effects of green tea extract on suppression of cellular proliferation through testing the expression of miR-34a in PC3 prostate cancer cells. In this respect, PC3 prostate cancer cells were cultured and treated with green tea extract for 48â€‰h. By using the qRT-PCR method, the expression of miR-34a was analyzed. Moreover, the expression of key proteins to regulate cellular proliferation, such as prostate specific antigen (PSA), AKT, cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin B1, c-Myc, p53, and phospho-androgen receptor (p-AR) was evaluated by using western blot. Our results indicated the induction of miR-34a, p53, and the inhibition of cyclin B1, p-AR, CDK1, p-AKT, PSA, c-Myc, and p-CDK1. Our findings can be used to design anti-tumor regimens that utilize natural product ingredients. However, additional research will be needed to identify anticancer activities of green tea via miR-34a in prostate cancer cells.",
