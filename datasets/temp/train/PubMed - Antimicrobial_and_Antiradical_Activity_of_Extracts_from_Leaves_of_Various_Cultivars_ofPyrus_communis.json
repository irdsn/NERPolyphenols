  "abstract": "Certain plant raw materials are rich in antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds, which are highly valued in modern medicine. These include the leaves of various species and cultivars of pears. For our research, we chose the leaves of the common pear (Pyrus communis) and Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia). Four different extracts were obtained from all raw materials and were investigated for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. The content of total phenolics and flavonoids was measured using colorimetric methods, and antiradical activity was measured using DPPH and ABTS radical probes. The antimicrobial activity of extracts was measured using the disc diffusion method, and the amount of major antimicrobial components (hydroquinone and arbutin) was measured using the HPLC method. The highest amount of general phenols and flavonoids was found in ethyl acetate extracts in all cultivars, and the lowest amount of phenols was found in the remaining aqueous solution. The amount of general phenols positively correlated with the antiradical activity of extracts. The strongest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens corresponded to the highest content of hydroquinone and arbutin in ethyl acetate extracts. Extracts obtained from pear leaves showed an average content of phenolic compounds and average antiradical activity compared to extracts from other raw materials, especially green tea or bergenia leaves. The amount of hydroquinone was moderate, lower than that of arbutin. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was moderate due to the average amount of hydroquinone, which is the main antimicrobial compound.",
