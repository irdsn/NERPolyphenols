  "title": "A comprehensive review of herb microgreens as emerging functional foods: insights into their nutritional potential and health benefits.",
  "abstract": "Microgreens are young, immature plants widely used in salads and dishes for their nutritional value, color, texture, and flavor. Their compatibility with indoor and small-scale cultivation makes them a unique crop of modern controlled environment agriculture, addressing the growing demand of urban populations. Beyond their culinary appeal, microgreens are gaining recognition as nutrient-dense functional foods due to their high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, carotenoids, and phenolics, compared to mature greens and sprouts. Unlike sprouts, which are harvested after 2-7 days, microgreens are harvested between 7 and 21 days after the development of young true leaves, offering enhanced microbial safety. Among them, herb microgreens such as fenugreek, basil, mustard, fennel, coriander, and moringa stand out for their rich bioactive composition and potential therapeutic benefits. Their health-promoting properties include anti-hyperglycemic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and roles in immune modulation, cardiovascular health, and managing age-related diseases. As a result, their demand is increasing in both the food and pharmaceutical industries. This review explores the nutritional profile, therapeutic significance, human health perspectives, and culinary applications of various herb microgreens. Additionally, this review highlights the key research gaps and future directions to optimize their functional food potential for human health.",
