  "title": "A genome-wide association study reveals that DgFH18 and DgCMO-like are associated with flowering time in orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata).",
  "abstract": "Flowering is a tightly regulated process influencing yield and promoting plant genetic diversity and conservation. Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) exhibits excellent yield traits and stress resistance, making it ideal for animal husbandry and ecological restoration. However, the molecular regulatory factors of the flowering time of orchardgrass are still unknown, limiting its molecular breeding.",
