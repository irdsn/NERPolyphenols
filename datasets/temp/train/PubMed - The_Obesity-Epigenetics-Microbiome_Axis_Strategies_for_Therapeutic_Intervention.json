  "abstract": "Obesity (OB) has become a serious health issue owing to its ever-increasing prevalence over the past few decades due to its contribution to severe metabolic and inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The unbalanced energy metabolism in OB is associated with substantial epigenetic changes mediated by the gut microbiome (GM) structure and composition alterations. Remarkably, experimental evidence also indicates that OB-induced epigenetic modifications in adipocytes can lead to cellular \"memory\" alterations, predisposing individuals to weight regain after caloric restriction and subsequently inducing inflammatory pathways in the liver. Various environmental factors, especially diet, play key roles in the progression or prevention of OB and OB-related disorders by modulating the GM structure and composition and affecting epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we will first focus on the key role of epigenetic aberrations in the development of OB. Then, we discuss the association between abnormal alterations in the composition of the microbiome and OB and the interplays between the microbiome and the epigenome in the development of OB. Finally, we review promising strategies, including prebiotics, probiotics, a methyl-rich diet, polyphenols, and herbal foods for the prevention and/or treatment of OB via modulating the GM and their metabolites influencing the epigenome.",
