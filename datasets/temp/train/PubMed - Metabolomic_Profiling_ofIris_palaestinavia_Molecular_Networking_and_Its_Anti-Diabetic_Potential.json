  "abstract": "TheIrisgenus is known for its large blooms and significant conservation value, as well as its horticultural appeal. There are over 300 species of irises, which are widely distributed across the northern temperate zone.Iris palaestina(Baker) Barbey, commonly known as the Lebanese iris, is an endemic species of the Middle East with limited prior phytochemical research. This study was conducted to examine the metabolomic complexity and chemical profile of the flower extract ofI. palaestinausing advanced analytical tools. Molecular networking was employed to investigate its chemotaxonomy and phytochemical composition. In silico annotation tools-network annotation propagation (NAP), DEREPLICATOR, and MS2LDA-were applied to identify chemical classes and substructures within the extract. The flower extract ofI. palaestinawas found to contain diverse metabolite classes, including flavonoids, terpenoids, and lipids, with a total of 15 compounds annotated. Subsequent chromatographic separation yielded four major compounds, identified as the isoflavonoid irigenin, the flavonoid embinin, the xanthone mangiferin, and the lipidN-lauryldiethanolamine. Among these, irigenin and mangiferin exhibited significant α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, with IC50values of 32.1 μM and 36.1 μM, respectively. This study provides the first comprehensive metabolomic characterization ofI. palaestina, revealing it as a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals spanning multiple metabolite subclasses. These findings emphasize the possible use ofI. palaestinafor further pharmaceutical investigation and natural product discovery.",
