  "title": "Effects of Resveratrol on Adipocytes: Evidence from In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.",
  "abstract": "Obesity, a prevalent global health issue, arises from an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, leading to the expansion of adipose tissue and metabolic dysfunction. White adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy as lipids, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a pivotal role in energy dissipation through adaptive thermogenesis. Recent research initiatives have focused on finding strategies to decrease adipogenesis and fat mass accumulation and increase thermogenesis. Finding chemicals with anti-obesity properties would be beneficial. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound abundantly found in the skin of grapes and red wine, possesses anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-obesity properties. This literature review examines the effects of resveratrol on adipocytes in culture and adipose tissue in animal models of obesity. The existing evidence indicates that resveratrol may exert its anti-obesity effects by inhibiting adipogenesis, promoting the apoptosis of mature adipocytes, reducing lipid accumulation, and increasing thermogenesis. Further research utilizing animal and clinical studies is required to understand in detail the anti-obesity potential of resveratrol.",
