  "abstract": "Soy protein isolate (SPI) has poor emulsifying ability because of its low molecular flexibility and compact structure, limiting its application in extruded protein-based foods. Extrusion technology has emerged as a promising way to alter the structural properties of proteins. Therefore, the impacts of grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) on structural and emulsifying characteristics of SPI in extrusion field were explored in this study.",
