  "abstract": "Resveratrol glycoside (also known as polydatin, PLD), known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, has shown potential in mitigating fibrosis in various organs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PLD on high glucose-induced peritoneal fibrosis and its underlying mechanisms, focusing on the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)/interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling.",
