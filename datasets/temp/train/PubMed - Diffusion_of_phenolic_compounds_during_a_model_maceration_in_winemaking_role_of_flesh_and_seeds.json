  "abstract": "During red winemaking, diffusion of phenolic compounds from the grape berry cells into the liquid phase occurs simultaneously with the adsorption of the same compounds onto the pulp. In previous studies, we quantified the proportions of polyphenols diffusing from the skins and then assessed the amounts that can be fixed by the pulp. In this work, we added the impact of seeds, also present during vinification, by carrying out macerations in a model medium with the following berry compartments: skins, seeds, skins + seeds, skins + seeds + pulp.",
