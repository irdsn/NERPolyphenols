  "title": "Molecular Alterations in Ferroptosis and the Effects of Resveratrol: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death. Different from other types of cell death, ferroptosis is hallmarked by disruptions in iron metabolism, redox imbalance, antioxidant system imbalance, and lipid peroxidation. Therefore, ferroptosis triggers mitochondrial impairment, inflammation, and affects several signaling pathways. As such, modulating ferroptosis holds a promising potential for preventing its deleterious effect. Resveratrol (RSV) is a promising polyphenolic compound that modulates ferroptosis due to its chelating properties. Here, we explore the preventive effects of RSV in the molecular alterations of ferroptosis. This review systematically summarizes insights about the properties of RSV in the hallmarks of ferroptosis in animal models, highlighting its beneficial effects in modulating iron metabolism, redox imbalance, glutathione metabolism, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial impairment, signaling pathways, and inflammation. Importantly, we emphasize the promising effects of RSV in this context, indicating its relevance in further research.",
