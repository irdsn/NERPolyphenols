  "abstract": "Hempseed threshing residues are rich in phytochemicals such as polyphenols and flavonoids. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds have been associated with antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activities. The re-use of the hempseed threshing residues as value-added materials is, not only cost-saving, but also environmentally beneficial. It is therefore important to develop an effective method for extraction of phenolic compounds and flavonoids from hempseed threshing residues.",
