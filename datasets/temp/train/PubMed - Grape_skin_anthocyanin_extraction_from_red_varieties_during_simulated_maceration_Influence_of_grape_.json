  "abstract": "The impact of seeds on anthocyanin extraction from skins was assessed on four Italian red winegrape varieties presenting different anthocyanin profile. Grape skins were macerated alone or in presence of seeds for ten days in model solutions. Aglianico, Nebbiolo, Primitivo, and Sangiovese cultivars showed differences in the anthocyanin extraction rate, content, and profile. The presence of seeds did not significantly affect the anthocyanin content and forms extracted from skins and kept into solution, but it generally led to an increase in the polymerization rate. For the first time, anthocyanins adsorbed on seed surface have been quantified after maceration. The amount of anthocyanins retained by seeds was less than 4Â mg/kg berries and it seems variety-dependent, with a possible role of seeds number and weight. Individual anthocyanin forms were adsorbed mainly according to their abundance in the solution, but cinnamoyl-glucoside anthocyanin forms showed a higher affinity with seed surface.",
