  "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the sensory profiles of wines produced using the flash détente (FD) technique and to identify the flavor compounds contributing to the sensory characteristics. The FD technique was applied to two major grape varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Marselan, from the Changli region of China to produce high-quality wines with aging potential. Compared to the traditional macerated wines, the FD wines showed greater color intensity, mainly due to the higher levels of anthocyanins. Regarding the aroma characteristics, FD wines were found to have a more pronounced fruitness, especially fresh fruit note, which was due to the contribution of higher concentration of esters. Concurrently, FD wines showed an increased sweet note which was associated with increased lactones and furanones. In addition, FD wines exhibited reduced green and floral notes due to lower levels of C6alcohols and C13-norisoprenoids. With regard to mouthfeel, FD wines presented greater astringency and bitterness, which was due to the higher levels of phenolics. The total concentration of condensed tannins and condensed tannins for each degree of polymerization was considerably higher in FD wines due to the strong extraction of the FD technique. A significant increase in grape-derived polysaccharides and glycerol was also found in FD wines, contributing to a fuller body. This study contributed to an increase in the knowledge of the Changli region and demonstrated that the FD technique could be applied to the wine production in this region to address the negative impacts of rainfall in individual vintages.",
