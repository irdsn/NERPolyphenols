  "abstract": "Methylglyoxal (MGO), a reactive dicarbonyl compound, has been implicated in the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and neuronal dysfunction. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of the combination of trans-resveratrol and hesperidin (tRES-HESP) against MGO-induced neurotoxicity, focusing on memory dysfunction and depression-like behavior.",
