  "abstract": "Targeting and multidrug resistance are the significant problems of current antitumor drugs, and these problems become the key factors in the design of nanomedicine. Herein, Au NRs and OPC-Au NPs were prepared via the hydroquinone seedless growth method and proanthocyanidin (OPC) one-pot method, and then pH-GSH-near-infrared ΙΙ (NIR-ΙΙ)-responsive nano-prodrugs Au/DOX-ss LNRs and OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs were designed by the encapsulation of doxorubicin prodrug DOX-ss with Au-S affinity and thermal-sensitive liposomes. Interestingly, OPC endowed OPC-Au NPs with reducibility and excellent performance in terms of particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation rate, and drug loading rate. In particular, the photothermal efficiencies of OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs increased to 59.22% under the 1064 nm NIR-ΙΙ irradiation. Compared with free DOX-ss and Lipid DOX-ss, the IC50 of OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs was decreased by 91.68% and 97.60%, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of P-gp in MCF-7/ADR was significantly inhibited (decreased by 65%). The potential of proanthocyanidin remodels the pH-GSH-NIR-ΙΙ responsiveness and drug resistance of OPC-Au/DOX-ss LNPs for breast cancer treatment in NIR-ΙΙ photodynamic/photothermal therapy.",
