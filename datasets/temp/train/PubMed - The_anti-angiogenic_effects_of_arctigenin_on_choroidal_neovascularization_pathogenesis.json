  "title": "The anti-angiogenic effects of arctigenin on choroidal neovascularization pathogenesis.",
  "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is an ocular disease characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), resulting in severe visual impairment. Arctigenin is a natural lignan compound from Arctium lappa L. and has anti-inflammatory and vascular normalizing effects. Here, we investigated the anti-angiogenic effects of arctigenin on CNV formation. Laser-induced CNV model mice were orally administered arctigenin at 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 days before laser irradiation. Oral administration of arctigenin suppressed CNV formation, vascular leakage, and the proliferation of endothelial cells in the CNV lesions. Treatment with arctigenin at 30 μM attenuated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell proliferation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Moreover, arctigenin suppressed the phosphorylation of Src, which is involved in VEGF signaling. Arctigenin also inhibited VEGF-induced mitochondrial respiratory activation. These findings suggested that daily intake of arctigenin may have beneficial effects on nAMD.",
