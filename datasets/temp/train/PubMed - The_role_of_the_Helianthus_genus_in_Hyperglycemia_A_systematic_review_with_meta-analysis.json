  "title": "The role of the Helianthus genus in Hyperglycemia: A systematic review with meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Hyperglycemia is characterized by high and uncompensated glucose levels, leading to diabetes mellitus (DM). Helianthus species extracts may have hypoglycemic properties and can be used as a complementary therapy for diabetes and its complications. This review evaluates the effects of extracts from Helianthus species on glycemia reduction in preclinical and clinical studies. Studies that isolated compounds or other associated compounds with the extract did not measure the glycemic profile; review articles and in vitro and ex vivo articles were excluded. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocols, and the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation (SYRCLE) tool was used for preclinical studies risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment. 14 studies, including 12 preclinical and 1 clinical study, were included. A meta-analysis was applied to preclinical studies and showed a significant effect in reducing glycemia and HbA1c levels. Qualitative analysis of the clinical study has also shown a reduction in glycemia. Inulin and chlorogenic acid (CGA) were identified in HelianthustuberosusL. and HelianthusannuusL., respectively, as compounds possibly responsible for these pharmacological effects. Extracts of the Helianthus species have been effective in improving the glycemic profile, making it possible to control DM and minimize its complications.",
