  "abstract": "The increasing resistance of phytopathogenic bacteria to chemical pesticides has underscored the urgent need for novel bactericidal agents. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of stilbene derivatives for their antibacterial activity against six strains of plant-pathogenic bacteria. Among them, compoundST-A-8showed the optimal activity againstXanthomonas oryzaepvoryzae(Xoo) andErwinia aroideae, with both MIC values of 1.56 Î¼g/mL, which was more potent than the commercialized antibacterial agent thiodiazole copper. Furthermore, the mechanism ofST-A-8onXoowas preliminarily investigated, and the results showed thatST-A-8inhibited the biofilm formation as well as the production of extracellular polysaccharides inXoo. Additionally, it disrupted the integrity of the cell membrane and increased the production of ROS, leading to lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane. Therefore, compoundST-A-8may serve as a potential novel bactericide for the control of plant bacterial diseases.",
