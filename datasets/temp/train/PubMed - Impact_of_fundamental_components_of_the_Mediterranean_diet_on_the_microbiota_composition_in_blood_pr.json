  "title": "Impact of fundamental components of the Mediterranean diet on the microbiota composition in blood pressure regulation.",
  "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is a widely studied dietary pattern reflecting the culinary traditions of Mediterranean regions. High adherence to MedDiet correlates with reduced blood pressure and lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality. Furthermore, microbiota, influenced by diet, plays a crucial role in cardiovascular health, and dysbiosis in CVD patients suggests the possible beneficial effects of microbiota modulation on blood pressure. The MedDiet, rich in fiber and polyphenols, shapes a distinct microbiota, associated with higher biodiversity and positive health effects. The review aims to describe how various Mediterranean diet components impact gut microbiota, influencing blood pressure dynamics.",
