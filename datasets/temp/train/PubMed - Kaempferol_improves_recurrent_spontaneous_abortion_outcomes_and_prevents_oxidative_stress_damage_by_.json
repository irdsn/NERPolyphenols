  "abstract": "Kaempferol (KFL) is a natural flavonoid found in various vegetables and fruits, known for its biological properties such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, there is a lack of research on the potential impact of KFL on recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). This study sought to establish an RSA model by mating female CBA/J mice with male DBA/2 mice to assess the influence of KFL on RSA. The results demonstrated that KFL administration leads to a decrease in embryo absorption, reduces inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, and balances the T helper 1/T helper 2 ratio, ultimately enhancing pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, KFL was found to enhance placental development, decrease apoptosis, and alleviate oxidative stress in placental tissues of RSA mice. Besides, we investigated the impact of KFL on oxidation-damaged HTR-8/Svneo cells. The findings indicated that KFL mitigates oxidative damage in trophoblast cells by modulating the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed that KFL treatment leads to large transcriptome changes in HTR-8/Svneo cells. Overall, the research demonstrated that KFL has the potential to alleviate placental inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby enhancing pregnancy outcomes in RSA mice. The regulatory mechanism of KFL in reducing oxidative damage may be involved in modulating the NF-κB pathway.",
