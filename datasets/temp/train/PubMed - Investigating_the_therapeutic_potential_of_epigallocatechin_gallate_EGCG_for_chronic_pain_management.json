  "title": "Investigating the therapeutic potential of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for chronic pain management: mechanisms, applications, and future perspectives.",
  "abstract": "Chronic pain, a widespread condition impacting a large segment of the global population, involves persistent and diverse pain types including nociceptive, neuropathic, and the more recently defined nociplastic pain. This review explores the potential of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a key bioactive compound in green tea, known for its extensive biological activities that aid in pain management. Highlighting its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects, EGCG is posited as a promising alternative to conventional pain medications, which are often associated with significant side effects and dependency risks. Despite its therapeutic promise, EGCG's clinical application is hampered by poor bioavailability and stability. By outlining the current state of research and identifying gaps for future investigation, this review underscores the importance of integrating EGCG into a broader pain management paradigm. It advocates for extensive clinical trials to confirm EGCG's efficacy and safety in humans, aiming to establish it as a part of an integrative strategy for treating chronic pain, thus potentially reducing the reliance on conventional pharmacotherapy.",
