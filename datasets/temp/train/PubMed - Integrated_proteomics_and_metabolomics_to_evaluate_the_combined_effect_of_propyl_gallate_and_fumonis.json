  "title": "Integrated proteomics and metabolomics to evaluate the combined effect of propyl gallate and fumonisin B1 on colon inflammation in vitro and in vivo.",
  "abstract": "Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a pervasive hazardous substance in the environment, presenting significant threats to human health and ecological systems. Propyl gallate (PG) is an antioxidant widely used in foods, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and its occurrence is an emerging issue in environmental chemistry. These two common substances in foods are easily ingested by people and closely related to the human gut. The aim of the current study was to identify the combined effect of PG on FB1 in vivo and in vitro. In the work, it is found that PG reduced colon inflamation and production of inflammatory cytokines induced by FB1 in mice and Raw 264.7 cells. Proteomics and metabolomics clearly showed differentially expressed proteins and metabolites in the comparison between FB1-PG and FB1 groups, which revealed a particular focus on the Akr1b8 protein in NF-ÎºB signaling activity, the metabolic processes of nucleotide metabolism and ABC transporters. Comparative proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that Akr1b8 protein was positively correlated with glycerol and negatively correlated with LysoPC (24:1(15Z)) in the comparison of FB1 and FB1-PG. These findings provide important insights into the understanding of PG and FB1 interactions in humans and provide potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against colon inflammation.",
