  "title": "Effect of luteolin on ceftiofur intestinal absorption: the rational use of Caco-2 monolayer cell model and everted gut sac model.",
  "abstract": "The clinical utility of ceftiofur primarily stems from its broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. However, its limited oral bioavailability significantly constrains therapeutic effectiveness. Although natural flavonoids have been well-documented to facilitate intestinal drug transport, the potential of luteolin to enhance ceftiofur intestinal absorption and the mechanistic basis for this effect remain to be elucidated.",
