  "abstract": "Flavonoids are key secondary metabolites in plants and predominantly exist in their glycoside forms. UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) glycosylate flavonoids, enhancing their solubility and structural diversity, thereby conferring advantages to both plants and humans. However, no efficient method is currently available to screen for genes associated with flavonoid glycosylation. In this study, a multiomics association analysis was conducted using transcriptomic and metabolomic data, leading to the identification of four genes-CsUGT74Y1, CsUGTL30, CsUGT75L12, and CsUGT73A20-involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid glycosides from the tea plants. Enzyme activity analyses demonstrated that the four proteins encoded by these genes not only catalyze the biosynthesis of flavonoid 7-O-glucosides but also apigenin xyloside and luteolin xyloside. Additionally, the results of amino acid mutations analysis showed that the active centers for CsUGT74Y1 were including His 54, Lle 62, and Asp 253, for CsUGTA30 were including Lle 133, Arg 392, and Trp 373, for CsUGT75L12 were including Glu 371, Asp 387, and Trp 385, and for CsUGT73A20 were including Asp 288, Phe 289, and Trp 326, respectively. In plants, gene silencing experiments revealed significant increases in flavonoid glycoside content. This study not only provides a reference method for the efficient screening of UGTs involved in the glycosylation of secondary metabolites, but also establishes a molecular foundation for flavonoid xyloside biosynthesis in Camellia sinensis.",
