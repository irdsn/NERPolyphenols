  "abstract": "This study focuses on the development and evaluation of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as an efficient carrier for the co-delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and kaempferol (KMF) in breast cancer treatment. PTX, a BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System)-IV class drug, was combined with KMF, a flavonoid extracted and isolated from bee pollen, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The optimal synergistic ratio of PTX and KMF was incorporated into SLNs using a hot homogenization technique, resulting in PTX-KMF-SLNs with a stable core-shell structure, narrow size distribution (166.1 ± 3.2 nm), and high encapsulation efficiency (86.15 ± 4.52%).In vitrostudies demonstrated that PTX-KMF-SLNs exhibited five times greater cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared to the free drug combination while minimizing systemic toxicity. Preclinical evaluation further confirmed a significant reduction in tumor volume, highlighting the enhanced therapeutic potential of the nanoformulation. The antioxidant properties of KMF contributed to improved drug stability and targeted delivery, making PTX-KMF-SLNs a promising nanocarrier system for breast cancer therapy. The nanoformulation SLNs effectively reduced tumor volume in preclinical models, showing strong therapeutic potential. Future prospects include clinical translation, personalized therapy, application to other cancers, and development of targeted or stimuli-responsive delivery systems. This formulation represents a promising strategy for safe and effective breast cancer therapy.",
