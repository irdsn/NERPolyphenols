  "abstract": "Gardenia jasminoides Ellis (G. jasminoides), as an emerging food resource, is rich in various bioactive compounds including polysaccharides, flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolic acids, which confer health benefits to the human body. Notably, G. jasminoides polysaccharides, as macromolecular components with significant pharmacological activities, have attracted increasing attention from researchers. To deepen the understanding of G. jasminoides polysaccharides, this review summarizes key aspects including preparation techniques, structural characteristics, and pharmacological activities. Analysis indicates that ultrasonic extraction exhibits higher efficiency and lower contamination compared to traditional solvent extraction methods, making it suitable for green chemistry and sustainable production. Moreover, G. jasminoides polysaccharides display a broad molecular weight distribution and complex monosaccharide composition, and their unique structural characteristics contribute to diverse pharmacological activities. Pharmacological studies have revealed that G. jasminoides polysaccharides can prevent liver injury by modulating gut microbiota and inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, G. jasminoides polysaccharides also demonstrate immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. In the future, further research on G. jasminoides polysaccharides is expected to provide stronger scientific support for their broad applications in the medical and food industries.",
