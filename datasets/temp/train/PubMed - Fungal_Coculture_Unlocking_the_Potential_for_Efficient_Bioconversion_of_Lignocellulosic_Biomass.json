  "title": "Fungal Coculture: Unlocking the Potential for Efficient Bioconversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass.",
  "abstract": "Microbial decomposition of persistent natural compounds such as phenolic lignin and polysaccharides in plant cell walls plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and underpins diverse biotechnological applications. Among microbial decomposers, fungi from theAscomycotaandBasidiomycotaphyla have evolved specialized mechanisms for efficient lignocellulosic biomass degradation, employing extracellular enzymes and synergistic fungal consortia. Fungal coculture, defined as the controlled, axenic cultivation of multiple fungal species or strains in a single culture medium, is a promising strategy for industrial processes. This approach to biomass conversion offers potential for enhancing production of enzymes, biofuels, and other high-value bioproducts, while enabling investigation of ecological dynamics and metabolic pathways relevant to biorefinery operations. Lignocellulosic biomass conversion into fuels, energy, and biochemicals is central to the bioeconomy, integrating advanced biotechnology with sustainable resource use. Recent advancements in -omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have facilitated detailed analysis of fungal metabolism, uncovering novel secondary metabolites and enzymatic pathways activated under specific growth conditions. This review highlights the potential of fungal coculture systems to advance sustainable biomass conversion in alignment with circular bioeconomy goals.",
