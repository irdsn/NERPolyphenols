  "abstract": "Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat) contains multiple bioactive substances and presents health benefits. In this study, a chrysanthemum extract (CE) was prepared by heat reflux extraction method and a functional yogurt was fabricated containing CE. According to the results of UPLC-MS/MS, 6 phenolic acids and 13 flavonoids were identified from CE compounds. The physicochemical and functional properties of yogurt during storage were investigated. In addition, rheology, microstructure and simulated digestion of yogurt on Day 1 were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the value of pH, total phenolic and flavonoid content, antioxidant capacity, the polyphenols stability in vitro gastric and intestinal digestion condition in the yogurt were enhanced. The syneresis, titratable acidity and the rate of protein hydrolysis in vitro gastric and intestinal digestion condition in the yogurt were reduced with CE addition. Moreover, the changes of protein network and sensory characteristics of yogurt were also occurred with addition of CE. These findings suggest that the integration of CE with yogurt is a promising way to improve the quality and storage ability of yogurt.",
