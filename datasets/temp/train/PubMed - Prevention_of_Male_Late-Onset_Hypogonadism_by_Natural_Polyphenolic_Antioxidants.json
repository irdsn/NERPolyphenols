  "abstract": "Androgen production primarily occurs in Leydig cells located in the interstitial compartment of the testis. In aging males, testosterone is crucial for maintaining muscle mass and strength, bone density, sexual function, metabolic health, energy levels, cognitive function, as well as overall well-being. As men age, testosterone production by Leydig cells of the testes begins to decline at a rate of approximately 1% per year starting from their 30s. This review highlights recent findings concerning the use of natural polyphenolics compounds, such as flavonoids, resveratrol, and phenolic acids, to enhance testosterone production, thereby preventing age-related degenerative conditions associated with testosterone insufficiency. Interestingly, most of the natural polyphenolic antioxidants having beneficial effects on testosterone production tend to enhance the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star) gene in Leydig cells. The STAR protein facilitates the entry of the steroid precursor cholesterol inside mitochondria, a rate-limiting step for androgen biosynthesis. Natural polyphenolic compounds can also improve the activities of steroidogenic enzymes, hypothalamus-pituitary gland axis signaling, and testosterone bioavailability. Thus, many polyphenolic compounds such as luteolin, quercetin, resveratrol, ferulic acid phenethyl ester or gigantol may be promising in delaying the initiation of late-onset hypogonadism accompanying aging in males.",
