  "abstract": "The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is a widely recognized dietary pattern, with its effects largely attributed to \"functional foods\" which are able to positively influence one or more target functions, improving health and maintaining a state of well-being.In this review, three \"case-study\" typical of the MedDiet, such as artichokes, capers and table olives are considered as traditional functional vegetables rich in bioactive compounds, mainly polyphenols. The review extensively discusses the antioxidant effects of these molecules, as well as their role in aging prevention and reduction, maintaining human health, and influencing the abundance and composition of intestinal microbiota. Additionally, this review focuses on the fate of the dietary polyphenols along the digestive tract.Among biotechnological strategies, the review explores the role of fermentation process in modifying the biochemical profile, recovery, bioaccessibility and bioavailability of bioactive compounds present in some vegetable foods of MedDiet. Finally, the main challenges in the selection, addition, and maintenance of probiotic strains in traditional food products are also summarized, with a view to develop new probiotic carriers for \"functional diets\".",
