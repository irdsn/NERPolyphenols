  "abstract": "Quercetin (Qc) is a natural bioactive compound derived from plants, with strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, its extreme water insolubility limits its bioavailability and practical utility. To address this, quercetin was encapsulated in ginkgo-derived starch nanoparticles (SNPs) to enhance solubility and stability. In this study, the bioactivity and cellular effects of the SNPs/Qc system were evaluated. Results showed excellent biocompatibility with no toxicity or adverse effects observed in experimental mice. At 25 Âµg/mL, SNPs/Qc significantly promoted early apoptosis in 3LL cells (33%) and blocked the cell cycle at G1 and G2 phases. The system demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on abnormal cell proliferation, with significant activity observed 6 h (hour) post-treatment. Compared with free quercetin, the SNPs/Qc system has dual advantages in improving the bioavailability of quercetin and tumor targeted penetration. After 15 days of ingestion, the survival rate of mice in the SNPs/Qc group increased by 20%, and the tumor volume was only 239 mm3, corresponding to a 49.4% decrease. At the same time, specific damage to the cell structure of tumor cells and higher intensity fluorescence accumulation were observed. This study reveals the potential of the SNPs/Qc system as a biocompatible and efficient delivery platform for natural bioactive compounds, particularly in health promotion and functional food applications.",
