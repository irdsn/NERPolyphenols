  "abstract": "Herein, we demonstrate that triacetyl resveratrol (TRES) can be employed as an antioxidant additive to suppress the formation of oxidation-induced defects in air-fabricated perovskite films. When assembling into carbon-based CsPbIBr2and CsPbI2Br cells, an enhanced efficiency of 10.38% and 14.98% has been achieved, with nearly unchanged efficiency after 1128 h of shelf storage in air and 86% of the initial efficiency after >1000 h aging at 85 Â°C.",
