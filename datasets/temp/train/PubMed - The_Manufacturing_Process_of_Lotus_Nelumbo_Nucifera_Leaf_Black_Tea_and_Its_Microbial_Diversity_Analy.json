  "abstract": "Lotus leaves combine both edible and medicinal properties and are rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds. In this study, the lotus leaf tea was prepared using a black tea fermentation process, and the functional components and microbial changes during fermentation were investigated. The results indicated that the activity of polyphenol oxidase showed an initial rise followed by a decline as fermentation progressed, peaked at 3 h with 1.07 enzyme activity units during fermentation. The lotus leaf fermented tea has high levels of soluble sugars (20.92 ± 0.53 mg/g), total flavonoids (1.59 ± 0.05 mg GAE/g), and total polyphenols (41.34 ± 0.87 mg RE/g). Its antioxidant activity was evaluated using ABTS, DPPH, and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays, with results of 18.90 ± 1.02 mg Vc/g, 47.62 ± 0.51 mg Vc/g, and 17.58 ± 1.06 mg Vc/g, respectively. The microbial community also shifted during fermentation.Fusariumplayed a significant role during the fermentation process. This study demonstrated that the black tea fermentation process improved the functional components and biological activity of lotus leaf tea by optimizing the synergistic effect of enzymatic oxidation and microbial fermentation. The findings not only realized the comprehensive utilization of lotus leaf resources but also provided a foundation for developing innovative functional beverages with enhanced bioactive properties.",
