  "abstract": "The liver is a well-known player in the metabolism and removal of drugs. Drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver detoxify drugs and xenobiotics, ultimately leading to the acquisition of homeostasis. However, liver toxicity and cell damage are not only related to the nature and dosage of a particular drug but are also influenced by other factors such as aging, immune status, environmental contaminants, microbial metabolites, gender, obesity, and expression of individual genes Furthermore, factors such as drugs, alcohol, and environmental contaminants could induce oxidative stress, thereby impairing the regenerative potential of the liver and causing several diseases. Persons suffering from other ailments and those with comorbidities are found to be more prone to drug-induced toxicities. Moreover, drug composition and drug-drug interactions could further aggravate the risk of drug-induced hepatotoxicity. A plethora of mechanisms are responsible for initiating liver cell damage and further aggravating liver cell injury, followed by impairment of homeostasis, ultimately leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species, immune-suppression, and oxidative stress.",
