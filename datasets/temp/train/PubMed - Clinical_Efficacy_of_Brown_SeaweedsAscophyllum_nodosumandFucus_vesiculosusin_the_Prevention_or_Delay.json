  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a global public health problem affecting nearly 25.9% of the world population characterised by a cluster of disorders dominated by abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, hypertriacylglycerolaemia and low HDL-cholesterol. In recent years, marine organisms, especially seaweeds, have been highlighted as potential natural sources of bioactive compounds and useful metabolites, with many biological and physiological activities to be used in functional foods or in human nutraceuticals for the management of MetS and related disorders. Of the three groups of seaweeds, brown seaweeds are known to contain more bioactive components than either red and green seaweeds. Among the different brown seaweed species,Ascophyllum nodosumandFucus vesiculosushave the highest antioxidant values and highest total phenolic content. However, the evidence base relies mainly on cell line and small animal models, with few studies to date involving humans. This review intends to provide an overview of the potential of brown seaweed extractsAscophyllum nodosumandFucus vesiculosusfor the management and prevention of MetS and related conditions, based on the available evidence obtained from clinical trials.",
