  "abstract": "Cutaneous overexposure to ultraviolet radiation has a variety of deleterious effects. The extent to which dietary factors are effective at moderating UV damage is a significant issue. Grapes contain phytochemicals that protect against excessive UV damage. Components of grapes, in particular resveratrol, proanthocyanidins, and cyanidin-3-glucoside, are receiving considerable attention for their photoprotective actions because of their lack of toxicity, abundance, and low cost. Resveratrol and proanthocyanidins are potent antioxidants that interfere with signal transduction and immunosuppressive pathways activated by UV radiation, which are responsible for its harmful effects. Studies in humans provide a rationale for their further development as a novel method of photoprotection.",
