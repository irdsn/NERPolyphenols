  "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of taxifolin (Tax), quercetin (Que), (+)-catechin (Cat) and luteolin (Lute) on the advanced Maillard reaction stage in the methylglyoxal-lysine (MGO-Lys) system. Since the four flavonoids share identicalA- andB-ring structures, the inhibitory effects and molecular mechanisms of flavonoids with differentC-ring structures onNε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) formation were revealed. The results demonstrated that Cat exhibited the best inhibitory effect on CEL with an inhibition rate of 53.78%, while Lute showed the lowest inhibition rate of 3.97%. The flavonoids (i.e., Tax, Que, Cat and Lute) inhibited the formation of non-fluorescent CEL, where hydroxylation at C3on theC-ring favored the enhancement of the inhibitory effect of the flavonoids on CEL, while the C2-C3double bond and the carbonyl group at the C4position reduced their inhibitory ability. The alkaline environment favored the enhancement of the inhibition of CEL by Tax, Que, Cat and Lute. Notably, Tax, Que, Cat and Lute can inhibit CEL formation by competitively capturing MGO to form mono- or di-adducts and reducing lysine consumption. This study provides innovative strategies and a theoretical foundation for developing effective CEL inhibitors in food thermal processing.",
