  "abstract": "Lycium ruthenicumpolyphenols (LRP) have been proven to be anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective phytochemicals. This study applies proteomics and metabolomics to LRP-treated db/db mice to explore its potential effects mechanism. The experiments were divided into three groups: normal control db/m group, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) db/db group, and LRP-treated db/db group. We examined physiological and biochemical indicators, behavioral indicators, and histopathology. As for the mechanism, we used TMT-based quantification proteomics and LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics for sciatic nerve and serum. After 8â€‰weeks of treatment, the fasting blood glucose level, mechanical withdrawal threshold, and thermal hyperalgesia were significantly improved. Pathological examination showed a significant alleviation in sciatic nerve histomorphology in the LRP group. Proteomics and metabolomics showed that the interventional effects of LRP were enriched mainly in oxidative phosphorylation, cardiac muscle contraction, and serum metabolites were enriched mainly in amino acid metabolism. LRP improves neurological function by improving mitochondrial functions, promoting neuronal development, and ameliorating dysregulation of amino acid metabolism. These results provide theoretical evidence for LRP as a potential functional food ingredient for the prevention and treatment of DPN.",
