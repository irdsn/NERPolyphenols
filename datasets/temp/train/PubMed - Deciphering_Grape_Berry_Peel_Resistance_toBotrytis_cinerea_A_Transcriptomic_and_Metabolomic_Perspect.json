  "title": "Deciphering Grape Berry Peel Resistance toBotrytis cinerea: A Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Perspective.",
  "abstract": "The fruit peel serves as the frontline defense of grapes against pathogens likeBotrytis cinerea, yet its defense mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study reveals novel resistance mechanisms underlying peel immunity through comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis ofVitis amurensis\"Bei Binghong\" (BH) andV. vinifera\"Red Globe\" (RG). The analysis identified 1277 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 38 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs), primarily associated with secondary metabolic processes and plant hormone signaling pathways. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) uncovered three key modules and several novel hub genes. Crucially, transcriptomic profiling identifiedVaWRKY20as a central regulator. Postinfection, upregulated genes and metabolites were involved in salicylic acid (SA), lignin, and stilbene biosynthesis in BH, as well as enhanced resistance through overexpression ofVaWRKY20. A conceptual model forV. amurensisdefense againstB. cinereawas proposed, providing novel insights into grapevine defense mechanisms.",
