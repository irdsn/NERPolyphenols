  "abstract": "The cohort of diethylstilbestrol (DES)-exposed people is aging, and a substantial fraction have already passed the age of 65, when unexposed average-risk people may exit cervical cancer screening provided they have had adequate prior screening. Current guidelines exclude individuals with a history of in utero exposure to DES. This clinical consensus includes a systematic review of relevant studies and provides updated guidance for surveillance of the aging DES-exposed cohort.",
