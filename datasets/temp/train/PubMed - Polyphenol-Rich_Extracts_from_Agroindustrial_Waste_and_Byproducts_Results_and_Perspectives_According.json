  "title": "Polyphenol-Rich Extracts from Agroindustrial Waste and Byproducts: Results and Perspectives According to the Green Chemistry and Circular Economy.",
  "abstract": "Polyphenols are natural secondary metabolites found in plants endowed with multiple biological activities (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, and anticancer). In view of these properties, they find many applications and are used as active ingredients in nutraceutical, food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic formulations. In accordance with green chemistry and circular economy strategies, they can also be recovered from agroindustrial waste and reused in various sectors, promoting sustainable processes. This review described structural characteristics, methods for extraction, biological properties, and applications of polyphenolic extracts obtained from two selected plant materials of the Mediterranean area as olive (Olea europaeaL.) and pomegranate (Punica granatumL.) based on recent literature, highlighting future research perspectives.",
