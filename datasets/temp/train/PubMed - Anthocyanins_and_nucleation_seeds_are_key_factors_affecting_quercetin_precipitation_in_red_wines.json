  "abstract": "Climate changes have been leading to an excessive synthesis of quercetin (Q) and its glycosides (Q-Gs) in specific red grape varieties, such as Sangiovese. This has resulted in concentrations overcoming the solubility threshold of Q in wines, with the consequent formation of undesirable precipitates. This study aims at assessing the impact of various factors, including anthocyanins, temperature, nucleation seeds and time, on the precipitation of Q in red wine.",
