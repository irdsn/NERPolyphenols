  "title": "Production of a food-grade pickering emulsion stabilized by pea protein-different phenolic acids.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to use pea protein isolate-phenolic acids (PPI-PA) to create novel functional stabilizers for Pickering emulsions. The stabilizers were produced by the covalent bonding of PPI with gallic acid (GA), ferulic acid (FA), coumaric acid (CA), and chlorogenic acid (CGA). Structural changes resulting from PPI-PA interactions were characterized using FTIR, XRD, SEM, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Antioxidant properties were also evaluated. The emulsifying activity index (EAI), emulsion stability index (ESI), contact angle, surface tension, Î¶-potential, optical properties, and confocal microscopy were used to evaluate the Pickering emulsions stabilized by PPI-PA conjugates.",
