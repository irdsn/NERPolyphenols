  "abstract": "Quinoa bran is a by-product of quinoa processing and is rich in polyphenolic bioactives. Previous studies have shown that polyphenol compounds can help alleviate metabolic diseases, but studies on quinoa bran polyphenols intervening in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have not yet been reported. In this study, a C57BL/6J mouse NAFLD model was established using a high-fat diet (HFD) to explore the interventional effects of quinoa bran polyphenol extract (QBP) on NAFLD in mice. The results showed that QBP was effective in attenuating abnormal lipid metabolism and hepatic fat accumulation and reducing inflammation in NAFLD mice. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that QBP regulated the composition of the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteriaClostridium_innocuum_group,Clostridium_sensu_stricto_13,Ruminococcus_gnavus_group,Coriobacteriaceae_UCG_002andUBA1819. Untargeted metabolomics identified 51 differential metabolites due to QBP supplementation. Functional predictions indicated that starch and sucrose metabolism and pentose and gluconate interconversion are key metabolic pathways for QBP to attenuate NAFLD, which may be influenced by the gut microbiota. These results demonstrated the potential application of QBP interventions for NAFLD.",
