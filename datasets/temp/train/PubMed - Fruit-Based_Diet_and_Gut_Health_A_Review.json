  "abstract": "Gut health is essential to the overall well-being of a human being due to its implication on digestion, the performance of the immune system, and nutritional absorption. The gut microbiota represents an intricate ecology of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, important in regulating the immune response and maintaining intestinal health. Fruit-based diets have developed as an essential constituent in gut health, and current studies highlight nutrition in modulating gut microbiota composition and activity. Rich in fiber, polyphenols, vitamins, and antioxidants, fruits also expand immunological function, subordinate inflammation in the stomach, and boost microbial diversity. The article reviews the benefits of fruit-derived dietary fibers, which assist as prebiotics in fostering the development of beneficial gut microbiota and decreasing intestinal inflammation. These antioxidants in fruits include flavonoids and carotenoids, whose immunomodulatory properties are under investigation for therapeutic use in autoimmune diseases, infections, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Some fruits of particular interest include bananas, apples, citrus, and berries, as studies have consistently shown their immunomodulatory and gastrointestinal effects. There are still barriers to increasing fruit intake, including socioeconomic restrictions and the need for personalized nutritional counseling. The review fills an existing gap in the literature. It encourages enhanced immune and gastrointestinal well-being by combining the most recent research with practical recommendations on implementing fruit-based diets into daily nutrition.",
