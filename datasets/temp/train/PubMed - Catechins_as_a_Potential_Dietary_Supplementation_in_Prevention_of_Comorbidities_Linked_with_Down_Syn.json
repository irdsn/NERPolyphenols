  "abstract": "Plant-derived polyphenols flavonoids are increasingly being recognized for their medicinal potential. These bioactive compounds derived from plants are gaining more interest in ameliorating adverse health risks because of their low toxicity and few side effects. Among them, therapeutic approaches demonstrated the efficacy of catechins, a major group of flavonoids, in reverting several aspects of Down syndrome, the most common genomic disorder that causes intellectual disability. Down syndrome is characterized by increased incidence of developing Alzheimer's disease, obesity, and subsequent metabolic disorders. In this focused review, we examine the main effects of catechins on comorbidities linked with Down syndrome. We also provide evidence of catechin effects on DYRK1A, a dosage-sensitive gene encoding a protein kinase involved in brain defects and metabolic disease associated with Down syndrome.",
