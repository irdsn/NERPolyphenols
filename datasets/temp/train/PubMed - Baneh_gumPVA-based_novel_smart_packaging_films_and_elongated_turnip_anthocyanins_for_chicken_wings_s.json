  "abstract": "Dry matter of Baneh gum (DMBG)-based smart films were developed by incorporating of elongated turnip anthocyanins (ElTAs) to monitoring of chicken wings spoilage. The ElTAs solution displayed pH-responsive color-varying features with distinguishable volatile-amines identifying. The thickness of the films ranged from 30 ± 1 to 80 ± 2 μm. The addition of ElTAs into the films matrix resulted in an increase of tensile strength (TS) and a decrease of elongation at break (EAB%) and moisture content (MC%), respectively. Microstructure analyses showed a smooth and compact surface morphology of the film's matrix and that ElTAs were dispersed within it. The stability properties of the films were evaluated in different storage environments over a period of 4 months. The highest color stability is achieved in the dark environment. The films showed that after 2 and 4 months of keeping, preserve the reusability property of color changes to detect of ammonia. The performance of film in monitoring the freshness chicken wings was evaluated. The TVB-N value of the chicken wings gradually increased to the rejection limit of >25 mg/100 g for 21 h. The smart films, with utilizable features are useful in providing food safety, and extending for evaluation of the food quality.",
