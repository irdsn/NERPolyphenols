  "title": "A cellulose-based fluorescent probe for the detection of hypochlorite and its applications in actual water samples and light emitting diode.",
  "abstract": "In order to achieve the detection of ClO-in the living environment, a fluorescent probe CHD was designed with good biodegradability by grafting a flavonol fluorophore onto functionalized cellulose. In the PBS solution, this probe can achieve the highly selective detection of ClO-, and the addition of hypochlorous acid can quickly quench the fluorescence within 90 s. NMR testing has demonstrated that ClO-can oxidize the detection group methyl sulfide to sulfoxide on the fluorescent probe. In addition, the CHD probe can be used for the detection of ClO-in actual water samples, with a recovery rate of 98.53 %-113.67 %. Moreover, fluorescent biomass film and smartphone detection have expanded the application of probe CHD. Besides, the lake green LED was prepared using CHD powder with solid-state fluorescence performance, making it more promising.",
