  "abstract": "Agricultural waste management poses a significant challenge in circular economy strategies. Olive mill wastes (OMW) contain valuable biomolecules, especially phenolic compounds, with significant agricultural potential. Our study evaluate the effects of phenolic extract (PE) derived from olive mill solid wastes (OMSW) on pomegranate agro-physiological and biochemical responses, as well as soil-related attributes. Pomegranate plants were treated with PE at doses of 100 ppm and 200 ppm via foliar spray (L100 and L200) and soil application (S100 and S200). Results showed increased biomass with PE treatments, especially with soil application (S100 and S200). Proline and soluble sugar accumulation in leaves suggested plant adaptation to PE with low-level stress. Additionally, PE application reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents. Higher doses of PE (S200) significantly improved net photosynthesis (Pn), transpiration rate (E), water use efficiency (WUEi), and photosynthetic efficiency (fv/fm and PIabs). Furthermore, PE treatments enhanced levels of chlorophylls, carotenoids, polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity. Soil application of PE also increased soil enzyme activities and microbial population. Our findings suggest the beneficial impact of PE application on pomegranate agro-physiological responses, laying the groundwork for further research across various plant species and soil types to introduce nutrient-enriched PE as an eco-friendly biostimulant.",
