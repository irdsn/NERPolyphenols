  "abstract": "Secondary metabolites, polyphenols, are widespread in the entire kingdom of plants. They contain one or more hydroxyl groups that have a variety of biological functions in the natural environment. These uses include polyphenols in food, beauty products, dietary supplements, and medicinal products and have grown rapidly during the past 20 years. Antimicrobial polyphenols are described together with their sources, classes, and subclasses. Polyphenols are found in different sources, such as dark chocolate, olive oil, red wine, almonds, cashews, walnuts, berries, green tea, apples, artichokes, mushrooms, etc. Examples of benefits are antiallergic, antioxidant, anticancer agents, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and antimicrobe properties. From these sources, different classes of polyphenols are helpful for the growth of internal functional systems of the human body, providing healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases, improving brain health, and rebooting our cellular microbiome health by mitochondrial uncoupling. Among the various health benefits of polyphenols (curcumin, naringenin, quercetin, catechin, etc.) primarily different antimicrobial activities are discussed along with possible future applications. For polyphenols and antimicrobial agents to be proven safe, adverse health impacts must be substantiated by reliable scientific research as well as in vitro and in vivo clinical data. Future research may be influenced by this evaluation.",
