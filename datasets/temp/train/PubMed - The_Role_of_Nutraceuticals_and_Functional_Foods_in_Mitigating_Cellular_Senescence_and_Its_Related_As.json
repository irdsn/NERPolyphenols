  "abstract": "As life expectancy continues to increase, it becomes increasingly important to extend healthspan by targeting mechanisms associated with aging. Cellular senescence is recognized as a significant contributor to aging and neurodegenerative disorders. This review examines the emerging role of nutraceuticals and functional foods as potential modulators of cellular senescence, which may, in turn, influence the development of neurodegenerative diseases. An analysis of experimental studies indicates that bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, vitamins, and spices, possess substantial antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and epigenetic properties. These nutritional senotherapeutic agents effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species, modulate gene expression, and decrease the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, minimizing cellular damage. Nutraceuticals can enhance mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and regulate inflammation, key factors in aging and diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Furthermore, studies reveal that specific bioactive compounds can reduce senescence markers in cellular models, while others exhibit senostatic and senolytic properties, both directly and indirectly. Diets enriched with these nutraceuticals, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been correlated with improved brain health and the deceleration of aging. Despite these promising outcomes, direct evidence linking these compounds to reducing senescent cell numbers remains limited, highlighting the necessity for further inquiry. This review presents compelling arguments for the potential of nutraceuticals and functional foods to promote longevity and counteract neurodegeneration by exploring their molecular mechanisms. The emerging relationship between dietary bioactive compounds and cellular senescence sets the stage for future research to develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases.",
