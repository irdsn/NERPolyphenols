  "title": "Effects of polystyrene microplastics on mice cardiac tissue structure: Protective role of resveratrol.",
  "abstract": "Microplastics, as ubiquitous environmental particles, can influence cardiac function both directly and indirectly. We examined the beneficial effects of resveratrol on the cardiotoxicity induced by 2-μm polystyrene microplastics in murine models. Male NMRI mice (n = 27) Control, PS-MPs (1 mg/kg), and PS-MPs + RV (1 mg/kg PS-MPs+2.5 mg/kg RV) were randomly grouped into three. Histological and antioxidant parameters were assessed after 90 days of exposure. Our findings indicated that PS-MPs induce toxicity via oxidative stress, catalase (CAT), Total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a reduction in glutathione (GSH) levels, while concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased relative to controls. We also found that cardiac abnormality in PS-MPs treated mice was accompanied by reduced antioxidant capacity, elevated oxidative stress, and elevated apoptotic signaling. Nevertheless, the protective effects of RV against disruptions in endoplasmic reticulum stress and antioxidant profiles resulting from PS-MPs exposure were evident, as RV normalized HSP40, HSP25, and HSP70 levels and enhanced antioxidant defenses. This implies that RV is a promising protective agent against toxicity induced by environmental contaminants such as microplastics.",
