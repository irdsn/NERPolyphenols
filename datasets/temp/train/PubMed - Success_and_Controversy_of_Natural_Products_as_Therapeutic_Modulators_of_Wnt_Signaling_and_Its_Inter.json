  "title": "Success and Controversy of Natural Products as Therapeutic Modulators of Wnt Signaling and Its Interplay with Oxidative Stress: Comprehensive Review Across Compound Classes and Experimental Systems.",
  "abstract": "The highly conserved Wnt signaling pathway, a complex network critical for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, regulates diverse cellular processes, ultimately influencing tissue organization and organogenesis; its dysregulation is implicated in numerous diseases, and it is known to be affected by oxidative pathways. This report reviews the recent literature on major classes of natural products with pronounced anti-oxidant properties, such as cardiac glycosides, steroid saponins, ecdysteroids, withanolides, cucurbitacins, triterpenes, flavonoids, and iridoids, that modulate its activity in various pathological conditions, summarizing and critically analyzing their effects on the Wnt pathway in various therapeutically relevant experimental models and highlighting the role of ROS-mediated crosstalk with Wnt signaling in these studies. Models reviewed include not only cancer but also stroke, ischemia, bone or kidney diseases, and regenerative medicine, such as re-epithelialization, cardiac maintenance, and hair loss. It highlights the paramount importance of modulating this signaling by natural products to define future research directions. We also discuss controversies identified in the mode of action of several compounds in different models and directions on how to further improve the quality and depth of such studies.",
