  "abstract": "Background/Objectives:This study evaluated the potential of a polysaccharide (PCS) extracted from the brown algaCystoseira spinosaas an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Collected off the coast of Alkhoms, Libya, PCS was investigated for its wound-healing and pro-angiogenic properties, addressing the need for natural bioactive compounds in therapeutic applications.Methods:The monosaccharide composition of PCS was analyzed using HPLC-RID, identifying glucuronic acid and xylose as major components. In vitro tests assessed antioxidant activity, while in vivo experiments on 24 rats evaluated wound healing. Rats were divided into four groups: control (saline), standard drug (CYTOL CENTELLA cream), glycerol, and glycerol+PCS. Wound healing was analyzed macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model assessed pro-angiogenic effects, and computational analyses explored COX-2 and VEGF pathways. Pharmacokinetic properties were also evaluated.Results:PCS demonstrated significant antioxidant activity and accelerated wound healing after 16 days, with improved wound appearance scores and increased collagen content. Histological analysis confirmed PCS outperformed the standard drug. The CAM model showed PCS increased blood vessel density, length, and junctions while reducing lacunarity. Computational analyses supported involvement of COX-2 and VEGF pathways. Pharmacokinetic assessments indicated good bioavailability, non-inhibition of CYP enzymes, and favorable skin permeability.Conclusions:PCS shows promise as a natural bioactive polymer for wound healing and tissue regeneration. Its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic properties, combined with favorable pharmacokinetics, highlight its therapeutic potential. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms ofC. spinosapolysaccharides and their application in promoting tissue repair.",
