  "abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a polyphenolic compound found in various plant species, has shown considerable potential in the treatment and management of several diseases due to its potent bioactive properties. Increasing evidence indicates that CGA exerts significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects by modulating key signaling pathways, including MAPK, PTEN/Akt, STAT3, and NF-ÎºB/NLRP3. Furthermore, CGA enhances intestinal barrier function and positively influences the gut microbiota composition, making it a promising natural therapeutic agent for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the most recent research on CGA's role in managing intestinal disorders. It first discusses CGA's chemical structure and pharmacokinetics (including absorption and metabolism), followed by an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms through which CGA mediates its therapeutic effects. These insights aim to advance our understanding of CGA's therapeutic potential in treating intestinal diseases.",
