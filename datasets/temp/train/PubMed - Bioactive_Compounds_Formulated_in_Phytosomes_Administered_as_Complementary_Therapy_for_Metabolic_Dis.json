  "abstract": "Metabolic disorders (MDs), including dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and cardiovascular diseases are a significant threat to human health, despite the many therapies developed for their treatment. Different classes of bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and triterpenes have shown therapeutic potential in ameliorating various disorders. Most of these compounds present low bioavailability when administered orally, being rapidly metabolized in the digestive tract and liver which makes their metabolites less effective. Moreover, some of the bioactive compounds cannot fully exert their beneficial properties due to the low solubility and complex chemical structure which impede the passive diffusion through the intestinal cell membranes. To overcome these limitations, an innovative delivery system of phytosomes was developed. This review aims to highlight the scientific evidence proving the enhanced therapeutic benefits of the bioactive compounds formulated in phytosomes compared to the free compounds. The existing knowledge concerning the phytosomes' preparation, their characterization and bioavailability as well as the commercially available phytosomes with therapeutic potential to alleviate MDs are concisely depicted. This review brings arguments to encourage the use of phytosome formulation to diminish risk factors inducing MDs, or to treat the already installed diseases as complementary therapy to allopathic medication.",
