  "abstract": "The autochthonous lactic acid bacteria were better suited for representing wine styles, typicity, and regional variations in oenological regions. The oenological characteristics of native O. oeni and L. plantarum were assessed during malolactic fermentation in four varietal wines from three subregions of Helan Mountain's Eastern Foothills. Oe144-46 exhibited higher viable cells, greater malate degradation and higher lactate yield across wines. However, LpXJ25 effectively mitigated color loss and enhanced color saturation and brightness consistently with alteration in polyphenolic profiles. Volatile compounds analysis revealed that LpXJ25 significantly increased total terpene content among wines by 4-7 folds, especially Î±-terpinenol, geraniol, citronellol and terpinen-4-ol, therefore enhancing floral complexity. Meanwhile, Oe144-46 notably elevated ester levels, intensifying fruity flavor profiles, primarily attributed to isopentyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethyl nonylate, and ethyl octanoate. The comprehensive evaluation of the metabolic similarities and disparities between O. oeni and L. plantarum provides a viable approach to developing distinctive wine products.",
