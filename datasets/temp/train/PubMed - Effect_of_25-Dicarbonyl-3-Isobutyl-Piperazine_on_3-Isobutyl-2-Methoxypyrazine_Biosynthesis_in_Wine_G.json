  "abstract": "The metabolic pathway of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines (MPs) in grape remains largely unclear except for the final step. In this study, the 2,5-dicarbonyl-3-isobutyl-piperazine (DCIP), which is proposed as the key intermediate of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) biosynthesis, was incorporated into Cabernet Sauvignon clusters insituusing a soaking method. The IBMP concentration of grape and the expression patterns of VvOMTs in berry skin were monitored over two consecutive years. The results showed that the IBMP concentration of grape treated with DCIP was significantly increased at maturity in both years. The relative expression levels ofVvOMT1andVvOMT3in berry skin were positively correlated with the IBMP accumulation. After DCIP incorporation, the relative expression level ofVvOMT1and particularly that ofVvOMT3were obviously up-regulated and closely mirrored the IBMP accumulation pattern in two consecutive years. Therefore, we speculate that DCIP may be a key intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of IBMP and plays an important role in regulating IBMP accumulation.",
