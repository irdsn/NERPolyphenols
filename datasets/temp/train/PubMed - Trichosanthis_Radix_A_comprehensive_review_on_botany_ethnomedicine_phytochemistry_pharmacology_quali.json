  "title": "Trichosanthis Radix: A comprehensive review on botany, ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control and toxicology.",
  "abstract": "Trichosanthis Radix, derived from the roots of Trichosanthes kirilowii Maximowicz and Trichosanthes rosthornii Harms, is used widely in traditional Asian medicine. It has been used for centuries across China, Japan, South Korea, and other Asian countries to treat several ailments, including diabetes, cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. The pharmacopoeias in several countries recognize its ability to clear heat, reduce swelling, expel pus, generate fluids, and regulate menstruation. This review provides a comprehensive synopsis of botanical, and ethnomedicinal uses of Trichosanthis Radix. In addition, the phytochemical constituents, including proteins (trichosanthin), terpenoids (cucurbitacins), alkaloids, lignans, coumarins, and flavonoids, which contribute to its diverse pharmacological effects including antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, abortifacient, neuroprotective, immunoregulatory, and antiviral activities are examined. Furthermore, the clinical, pharmacokinetic, quality control measures, processing methods, and toxicity associated with Trichosanthis Radix are discussed. Finally, future research opportunities and potential applications of Trichosanthis Radix in modern medicine are explored with a focus on expanding its therapeutic use and ensuring safe and effective medicinal applications.",
