  "title": "Natural products as promising therapeutics for fine particulate matter-induced skin damage: a review of pre-clinical studies on skin inflammation and barrier dysfunction.",
  "abstract": "Particulate matter less than 2.5 Âµm (PM2.5) is a significant air pollutant and is linked to an increased risk of health conditions, including skin diseases. The skin, as the first barrier and the largest organ, is primarily damaged by PM2.5 through different pathways. Several studies have shown that PM2.5 upregulates inflammatory responses through the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several inflammatory cytokines, leading to PM2.5-induced skin damage. The ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Cyclooxygenase-2-Prostaglandin E2 (COX2/PGE2) inflammatory pathways are activated by free radical scavenging and phase II detoxification. Natural products have been suggested as therapeutic agents for mitigating PM2.5-induced skin damage.",
