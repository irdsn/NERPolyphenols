  "title": "Comparative study on selenium content and nutritional quality of five different varieties of white tea.",
  "abstract": "Tea, second only to water in consumption, is rich in nutrients. Selenium, a crucial trace element, has unclear relationships with other substances in tea leaves. This study analyzed five white teas, measuring selenium, five minerals, and various chemical components. The results showed that there were significant differences in the elemental and chemical characteristics among these tea. Correlation analysis showed that low-level selenium might have a synergistic effect with iron, magnesium and potassium, while the correlations between other elements in tea leaves, total proteins, and total amino acids with selenium were not significant. In addition, the contents of flavonoids and polyphenols were significantly negatively correlated with the selenium content. These results indicated that selenium has a significant impact on the accumulation of minerals, flavonoids, and polyphenols in tea leaves. This study disclosed white tea's elemental and chemical basis, supplying a theoretical basis for quality evaluation, crucial for the tea industry.",
