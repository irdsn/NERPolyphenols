  "title": "Efficacy of a resveratrol nanoformulation prepared using a facile solvent-free method.",
  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenolic compound known for its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective properties. However, the limited water solubility and poor bioavailability of RSV significantly hinder its application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. To address these challenges, we developed a facile, scalable, and specifically, organic-solvent-free method to prepare highly stable and concentrated RSV nanoformulations. By utilizing an ethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil (EHCO) aqueous solution, we successfully dissolved RSV in water at concentrations of up to 30 mg mL-1. This RSV solution could be subsequently incorporated with hydrogenated lecithin S10 to formulate stable lipid nanoparticles, sized 140-180 nm. The entire process was performed under heating and stirring, eliminating the need for organic solvents and ensuring simplicity and high reproducibility. The resulting RSV-CO60@S10 nanoformulations exhibited relatively high encapsulation efficiency (with final RSV concentrations of up to 30 mg mL-1), long-term stability (exceeding 6 months), preserved antioxidant activity, and effective cellular internalization capabilities that could alleviate oxidative stress. Additionally, these nanoparticles exhibited promising therapeutic efficacy toward atopic dermatitis in mice. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential utilization of RSV across diverse applications.",
