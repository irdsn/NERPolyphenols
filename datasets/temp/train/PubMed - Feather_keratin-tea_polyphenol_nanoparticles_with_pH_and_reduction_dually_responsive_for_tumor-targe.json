  "abstract": "The intelligent nanomedicine delivery system loaded with small molecule chemotherapy drugs provides an effective solution strategy for reducing the toxic side effects of small molecule chemotherapy drugs and improves the targeted treatment of chemotherapy drugs. However, it remains challenging to fabricate pH and reduction dual-responsive anticancer drug carrier derived from purely natural polymers, while simultaneously endowing the carrier with ideal nanoscale dimension and excellent storage stability. Here, we have invented a simple method for preparing anti-cancer drug delivery system using tea polyphenols and feather keratin as raw materials, utilizing their chemical reactions and molecular assembly as driving forces. The drug delivery system: feather keratin-tea polyphenol nanoparticles have biocompatibility, colloidal stability, and stimulus responsive drug release properties. The particle size and surface zeta potential of the feather keratin-tea polyphenol nanoparticles are around 100 nm and -20.6 mV, respectively, which makes nanoparticles have good storage stability. Nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin: DOX@FK-TP NPs also have a nanoscale particle size and have pH and reduction dual stimuli-responsive properties, which can sensitively release DOX within the unique tumor microenvironment. At the same time, feather keratin-tea polyphenol nanoparticles effectively improve the cycling stability of tea polyphenols in vivo and exhibit a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on liver cancer cell HepG2. So, this study also provides ideas for better utilization of tea polyphenols.",
