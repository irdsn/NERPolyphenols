  "title": "Effects of resveratrol supplementation on renal function in adults: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "The influence of resveratrol on renal function was previously examined; nevertheless, the findings are inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on renal function. A comprehensive search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to March 1st, 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of resveratrol supplementation on the urea, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin, total protein, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and creatinine (Cr) were included. A total of 2299 participants from 31 studies were included. Meta-analysis of studies indicated that resveratrol supplementation in comparison to placebo had favorable effects on the values of BUN [weighted mean difference (WMD) =  - 1.20; 95% CI: - 1.89, - 0.51 mg/dL; I2= 84.6%; 95% CI: 77, 90%; Tau2= 1.41; P < 0.001]. Based on the subgroup analysis, significant improvement was seen in Cr and GFR in the subgroup of participants without diabetes. Additionally, resveratrol supplementation for more than 8 weeks or at doses higher than 500 mg/d significantly elevated GFR and total protein values, respectively. However, the circulating values of albumin and uric acid were not affected by resveratrol supplementation. Although dose-response analysis was conducted for dosage and duration of intervention, no significant results were found. Resveratrol supplementation might improve GFR, BUN, creatinine, and total protein concentrations in adults. However, it did not significantly affect the circulating values of albumin and uric acid.",
