  "title": "Resveratrol Mitigates Inflammation by Modulating Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptors (TNFRs) in a 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene Sulfonic Acid (TNBS)-Induced Rat Model of Colitis.",
  "abstract": "Several substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are currently being investigated as potential adjunctive or standalone treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One such substance is resveratrol (RES), also known as 3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, a natural dietary polyphenol with diverse health-promoting effects. In this study, male Wistar-Hannover rats received oral RES supplementation at doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days. On day 25 colitis was induced using intracolonic administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). Based on histological and planimetric analysis, the 10 mg/kg dose significantly reduced colonic ulceration and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) expression compared to the TNBS group. Immunohistochemistry also revealed that RES at this dose attenuated the intensity of TNF-α receptors, namely TNFR1 and TNFR2. Furthermore, the concentration of lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) was significantly elevated in TNBS-induced colitis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RES may exert its protective effects partly through the modulation of TNF receptor signaling in TNBS-induced colitis.",
