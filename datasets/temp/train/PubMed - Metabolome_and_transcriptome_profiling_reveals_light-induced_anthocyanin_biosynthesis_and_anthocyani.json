  "abstract": "Yam is a globally significant crop with both culinary and medicinal value. Anthocyanin, an important secondary metabolite, plays a key role in determining the nutritional quality of yams. However, the research on the light-induced anthocyanins accumulation in yams remains limited. In this study, we revealed light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis and identified transcription factors associated with anthocyanin-related pathways in yam. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying light-mediated anthocyanin regulation in yams.",
