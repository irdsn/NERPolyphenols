  "abstract": "Ovarian cancer presents a significant treatment challenge due to its insidious nature and high malignancy. As autophagy is a vital cellular process for maintaining homeostasis, targeting the autophagic pathway has emerged as an avenue for cancer therapy. In the present study, we identify apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100), a key modulator of lipid metabolism, as a potential prognostic biomarker of ovarian cancer. ApoB100 functioned as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer, and the knockdown of ApoB100 promoted ovarian cancer progression in vivo. Moreover, ApoB100 blocked autophagic flux, which was dependent on interfering with the lipid accumulation/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress axis. The effects of LFG-500, a novel synthetic flavonoid, on ApoB100 induction were confirmed using proteomics and lipidomics analyses. Herein, LFG-500 induced lipid accumulation and ER stress and subsequently blocked autophagy by upregulating ApoB100. Moreover, data from in vivo experiments further demonstrated that ApoB100, as well as the induction of the lipid/ER stress axis and subsequent blockade of autophagy, were responsible for the anti-tumor effects of LFG-500 on ovarian cancer. Hence, our findings support that ApoB100 is a feasible target of ovarian cancer associated with lipid-regulated autophagy and provide evidence for using LFG-500 for ovarian cancer treatment.",
