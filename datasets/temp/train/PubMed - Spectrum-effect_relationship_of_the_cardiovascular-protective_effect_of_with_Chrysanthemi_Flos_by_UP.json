  "abstract": "Chrysanthemi Flos (CF), as one of the important 'dual-use' plants, possesses great pharmacological research and development potential. This work aimed to find the pharmacodynamic material basis of CF in cardiovascular-protection by spectrum-effect relationship and component knock-out method. The fingerprint was established by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and 25 peaks were picked out as common peaks. The common peaks were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap-mass spectrometry including twelve flavonoids, nine phenylpropanoids, three organic acids, and one nucleoside. The cardiovascular-protective effect of CF was determined by angiotensin II-induced injury model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Grey relation analysis, partial least squares regression analysis and Pearson's correlation analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the cardiovascular-protective effect and ingredients. Spectrum-effect relationship and component knock-out method revealed that P11 (luteolin-7-O-Î²-D-glucoside), P14 (3,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid), P16 (1,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid), and P17 (3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid) were the pharmacological material basis for the cardiovascular-protective effect of CF. This work preliminarily elucidated the pharmacodynamic material basis of cardiovascular-protective effect of CF, which could be used to considerable methods and insight for the fundamental research of the pharmacodynamic material basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine.",
