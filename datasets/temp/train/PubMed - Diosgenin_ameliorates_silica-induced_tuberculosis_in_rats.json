  "abstract": "Silicosis is an occupational lung disease that is caused by chronic exposure to silica dust. Silica-exposed workers are at higher risk of developing TB, resulting in lung fibrosis and significant respiratory dysfunction. Diosgenin is a steroidal saponin that has been shown to exert a therapeutic effect on lung injury. Therefore, we investigated the potential efficacy of diosgenin in treating silicotuberculosis by evaluating its effectiveness against Mycobacterium smegmatis, as well as its antifibrotic and antioxidant effects in silica-induced TB in rats.",
