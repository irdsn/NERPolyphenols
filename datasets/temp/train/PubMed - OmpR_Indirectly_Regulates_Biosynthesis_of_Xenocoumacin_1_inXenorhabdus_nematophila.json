  "abstract": "Xenorhabdus nematophilahas excellent potential for application in both medicine and agriculture due to its various active secondary metabolites. The transcriptional regulator OmpR negatively regulates Xenocoumacin 1 (Xcn1), which has wide antimicrobial activity. Here, we expressed and purified OmpR and verified its binding activities to promoters via an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RNA sequencing was used to analyze the relevance and difference of differentially expressed genes betweenX. nematophilaand its mutantΔompR. Compared with the WT, 1127 differentially expressed genes were found inΔompR, while 4150 co-expressed genes were detected. RT-qPCR data validated the RNA-seq results with 20 randomly selected genes. OmpR positively regulates the process of porphyrin metabolism, quorum sensing, β-Lactam resistance and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, while negatively regulating the phosphotransferase system, two-component system and bacterial chemotaxis. OmpR indirectly regulates the biosynthesis of Xcn1 by positively regulating the process of glyoxylate metabolism, which consumes energy and precursors, and negatively regulates biomacromolecules biosynthesis, which provides energy and precursors. Overall, this work revealed the indirect effects of OmpR on the biosynthesis of Xcn1, serving as a foundation for future research into the intricate regulatory network ofX. nematophila.",
