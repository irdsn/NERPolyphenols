  "abstract": "Postovulatory oocyte aging significantly compromises oocyte quality, resulting in fertilization failure, abnormal embryonic development, and unfavorable outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenolic compound found in green tea, demonstrates the ability to effectively reduce excessive oxidative stress in oocytes and improve the quality of aged oocytes both in vitro and in vivo, offering promising potential for enhancing the success of ART and efficiency in livestock breeding.",
