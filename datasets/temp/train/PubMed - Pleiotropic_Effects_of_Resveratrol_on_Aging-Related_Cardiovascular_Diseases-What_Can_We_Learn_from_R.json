  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenol with natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is found in abundance in plants, i.e., grapes and mulberry fruit. In addition, synthetic forms of RES exist. Since the discovery of its specific biological properties, RES has emerged as a candidate substance not only with modeling effects on the immune response but also as an important factor in preventing the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous research provided strong evidence of the effects of RES on platelets, mitochondria, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial function. In addition, RES positively affects the coagulation system and vasodilatory function and improves blood flow. Not only in humans but also in veterinary medicine, cardiovascular diseases have one of the highest incidence rates. Canine and human species co-evolved and share recent evolutionary selection processes, and interestingly, numerous pathologies of companion dogs have a human counterpart. Knowledge of the impact of RES on the cardiovascular system of dogs is becoming clearer in the literature. Dogs have long been recognized as valuable animal models for the study of various human diseases as they share many physiological and genetic similarities with humans. In this review, we aim to shed light on the pleiotropic effects of resveratrol on cardiovascular health in dogs as a translational model for human cardiovascular diseases.",
