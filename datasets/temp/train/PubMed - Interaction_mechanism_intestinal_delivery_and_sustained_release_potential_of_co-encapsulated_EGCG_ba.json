  "title": "Interaction mechanism, intestinal delivery and sustained release potential of co-encapsulated EGCG based on sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin/casein composite nanoparticles.",
  "abstract": "Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is interesting for its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, poor chemical stability and inadequate bioavailability severely limit their widespread application. This research prepared a co-delivery system of encapsulated EGCG to improve the stability and utilization of polyphenols through the interplay of polyphenol (EGCG)-protein (Casein)-polysaccharide (Sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin) ternary composite nanoparticles (TCNPs). When the ratio was 1:1:1, the encapsulation efficiency of EGCG by the composite nanoparticles was 95.32 %. Hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds were the main driving forces for the formation of the TCNPs. TCNPs exhibited favorable re-dispersibility, antioxidant activity and stability, significantly reducing their photothermal sensitivity. TCNPs showed excellent stability and optimal antioxidant performance in a simulated gastrointestinal environment, and were relatively stable to acid and enzymatic hydrolysis. In summary, the TCNPs we prepared efficiently encapsulate and sustainably release EGCG, enhancing its stability, bioaccessibility in the gastrointestinal tract, and potential for intestinal targeted delivery.",
