  "abstract": "Aging is associated with fat atrophy and fibrosis with loss of adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. New approaches to this loss involve agents that can renew the proliferative and differentiative capacities of preadipocytes with the aim of creating new healthy adipose tissue that secrete adipokines that positively impact on skin health.",
