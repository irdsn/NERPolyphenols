  "abstract": "Previous studies found that it is promising to achieve the protective effects of dietary patterns on cardiovascular health through the modulation of gut microbiota. However, conflicting findings have been reported on how dietary patterns impact gut microbiota in individuals either established or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our systematic review aimed to explore the effect of dietary patterns on gut microbiota composition and on risk factors for CVD in these populations.",
