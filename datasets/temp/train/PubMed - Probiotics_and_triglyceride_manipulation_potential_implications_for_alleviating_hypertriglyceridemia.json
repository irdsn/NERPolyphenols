  "abstract": "Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most prevalent lipid abnormalities encountered in clinical practice. Although many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, in most patients, triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol abuse, high-fat foods, and the use of various commonly prescribed drugs. Notably, manipulating the gut microbiota through probiotic intervention may reduce triglyceride levels by targeting intestinal lipid absorption and host lipid metabolism.",
