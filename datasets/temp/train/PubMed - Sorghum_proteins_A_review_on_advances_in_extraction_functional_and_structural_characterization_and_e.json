  "title": "Sorghum proteins: A review on advances in extraction, functional and structural characterization, and emerging applications.",
  "abstract": "The rising global population and increasing food demands necessitate the exploration of sustainable protein sources that can minimize environmental impact. Sorghum protein is gaining attention as a viable alternative, due to crop's adaptability, high protein content, and the presence of bioactive compounds such as tannins in certain genotypes. Therefore, the present review was designed to provides a comprehensive analysis of biochemical composition, nutritive value, and functional attributes of sorghum proteins. The review further explores developments in extraction and purification methods, including enzymatic hydrolysis, ultrasonication, and novel solvent-based methods, aimed at enhancing protein yield, digestibility, and solubility. Despite its potential, the utilization of sorghum proteins in the food industry is hindered by challenges such as poor digestibility, hydrophobicity, and the presence of antinutritional factors. However, recent innovations in protein modification and food formulation strategies offer promising solutions to enhance their usability in gluten-free foods, emulsifiers, biodegradable packaging, and nutraceutical delivery systems. This review also includes the challenges limiting the broader adoption of sorghum proteins in the food industry, along with innovative approaches to overcome them. Therefore, this review will provide valuable insights into the potential of sorghum proteins as sustainable and alternative functional ingredients for food applications.",
