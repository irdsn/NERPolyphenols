  "abstract": "In the early 80s, the so-called \"French paradox\" was proposed, that is, a correlation between wine consumption, a diet rich in fats, and low mortality from coronary disease. Conversely, it is well established that excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of cirrhosis and cancer, but few studies have investigated the effects of moderate alcohol consumption. However, all these conclusions were derived from epidemiological population studies that may be subject to distortions due to multiple factors. Here, the effect of moderate consumption of red wine on health throughout life was examined in a murine model. Different variables were evaluated in groups of female animals that were fed a standard or a fat diet throughout their adult life and given water, or wine or alcohol diluted in water in proportions similar to what is considered moderate consumption in humans. Our results showed few differences in most of the analyzed variables (body weight, liver profile and survival rate) between the different female mouse groups. The most remarkable findings were observed in the fat-diet groups that showed more frequent and severe liver lesions and a lower average ovarian weight. Moreover, moderate and prolonged ethanol consumption significantly affected telomere length only when the diet was high in fat, whereas wine consumption showed no difference compared to water, pointing to a possible predominant role of the compounds, particularly polyphenols present in wine. On the other hand, wine-drinking mice fed a fat diet had more oocytes than those in the ethanol-drinking group. Overall, our data suggest that long-term moderate red wine consumption does not substantially influence the health of female mice.",
