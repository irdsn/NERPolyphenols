  "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic potential of hyaluronic acid/proanthocyanidin (HA/PAC) nanoparticles in treating alkali-induced corneal burns. Alkali burns are common ocular emergencies that can lead to severe vision impairment if not promptly and properly treated. The low water solubility of proanthocyanidins (PACs), which are potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents, limits their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, hyaluronic acid (HA) was utilized as a carrier to form HA/PAC nanoparticles, enhancing PAC's solubility and bioavailability. The HA/PAC nanoparticles were characterized for morphology, granulometric distribution, hemolysis, and cytotoxicity, demonstrating high blood compatibility and noncytotoxicity. Thein vitroantioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of HA/PAC were evaluated, showing enhanced activity compared to PAC alone.In vivostudies on C57 mice confirmed the accelerated healing of corneal injuries and reduced corneal opacity with HA/PAC treatment. Histopathological analysis and cytokine quantification further supported the anti-inflammatory and proregenerative effects of HA/PAC, suggesting its potential as an effective treatment for corneal alkali burns.",
