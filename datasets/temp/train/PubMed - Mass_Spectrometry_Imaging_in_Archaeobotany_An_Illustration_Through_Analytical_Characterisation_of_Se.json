  "abstract": "Morphological analysis has been frequently applied in archaeobotany. Recently, increasing studies have been conducted on the identification of biomarkers in archaeobotanical materials, which are rarely attached to morphological analysis. To improve the interpretability of biomarker analysis, the localisation of characteristic biomarkers in ancient samples is needed.",
