  "abstract": "Trichodermaspp. produce diverse secondary metabolites with biological activity. This study explored the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties of metabolites from two nativeTrichodermastrains, 10BR1 and UEPA AR12, isolated from rhizospheric soils. Organic extracts from both strains demonstrated broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, inhibiting Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as variousCandidaspecies, with notable efficacy againstStaphylococcus aureus(MICs: 15.6-31.25 µg/mL). The extracts also showed antibiofilm activity, with UEPA AR12 exhibiting the highest inhibition againstEscherichia coli(81.8%),Enterococcus faecalis(92.8%),Candida albicans(87.9%), andCandida parapsilosis(89.3%). Antioxidant activity, assessed via DPPH assay, revealed a dose-dependent radical scavenging effect (12.88% to 39.67% at 7.8-1000 µg/mL). Cytotoxicity assays indicated that UEPA AR12 extracts were more cytotoxic (IC50: 202.5-234.3 µg/mL) than 10BR1 (IC50: 368.7-602.1 µg/mL) in non-tumor cells, with similar trends in tumor cells (Huh7). HPLC/MS analysis identified 21 metabolites in the extracts. Genomic analyses, supported byrpb2gene and phylogenetic clustering, confirmed that both strains wereT. afroharzianum. FUNGISMASH revealed multiple biosynthetic gene clusters, predominantly Type I polyketide synthase (T1PKS). Additionally, targeted genomic analyses did not detect mycotoxin-related genes. These findings highlight the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and antioxidant potentials of these strains, positioning them as sources of bioactive metabolites for pharmaceutical applications.",
