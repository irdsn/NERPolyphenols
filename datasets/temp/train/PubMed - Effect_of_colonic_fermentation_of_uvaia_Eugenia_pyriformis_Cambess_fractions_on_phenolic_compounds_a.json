  "title": "Effect of colonic fermentation of uvaia (Eugenia pyriformis Cambess) fractions on phenolic compounds and gut microbiota composition: An in vitro study using the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®).",
  "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of colonic fermentation of uvaia seed and uvaia pulp on the phenolic compounds produced in the lumen and on the gut microbiota composition. Fermentation of uvaia pulp increased epigallocatechin, hippuric acid, ellagic acid, epicatechin gallate, and procyanidins in proximal colon (PC). The microbiota action on uvaia seed decreased hesperetin and quercetin in descending colon (DC). Fecal fermentation of uvaia pulp fraction showed the highest production of acetate (1469.82-5860.10 mg/L), propionate (543.72-3039.37 mg/L), and butyrate (8.58-2225 mg/L). Firmicutes decreased its overabundance after fermentation of both uvaia fractions. Feeding with uvaia seed reduced Veillonella in all the colon compartments and increased Akkermansia in DC. These results suggest that uvaia consumption can increase polyphenol concentrations in the gut lumen, primarily through the release of bound phenolic compounds from the plant cell wall during colonic fermentation, which in turn modifies the composition of the gut microbiota.",
