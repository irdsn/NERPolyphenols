  "title": "Innovative findings on three endemicCrataegusspp. from Türkiye: flavonoid-enriched extracts with cardiovascular benefits demonstrated by reduction of oxidative and inflammatory markers on rat aorta tissue.",
  "abstract": "Türkiye is a significant genetic diversity center for Crataegus species. The fruits, leaves, flowers, and sprouts of Crataegus sp. are widely used in traditional medicine, mainly for cardiovascular diseases. Products containing Crataegus monogyna Jacq. subsp. monogyna (\"alıç\") are recognized as therapeutic agents used alongside conventional treatments. Thus, investigating the chemical composition and biological activity of other Crataegus species is essential to explore their medicinal potential. This study provides the first report on total flavonoid content and detailed phytochemical profiling of leaf and immature fruit extracts from three endemic species-Crataegus peshmenii Dönmez, Crataegus petrodavisii Dönmez, and Crataegus christensenii Dönmez-using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A comparative analysis with C. monogyna subsp. monogyna was also included. Notably, C. peshmenii leaf extract was the richest in compounds linked to cardiovascular benefits, including vitexin and hyperoside. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties were further evaluated using isolated rat thoracic aortas. The release of inflammatory and oxidative markers was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). C. peshmenii leaf extract significantly reduced the levels of oxidative and inflammatory markers (MDA, MPO, TNF-α, and IL-1β) in isolated aortas, supporting its potential as a cardiovascular protective agent.",
