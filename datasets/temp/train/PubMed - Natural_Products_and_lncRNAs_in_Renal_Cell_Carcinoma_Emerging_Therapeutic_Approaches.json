  "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignant neoplasm arising from the renal epithelium and constitutes approximately 2% of global cancer diagnoses and mortalities. With increasing prevalence, RCC remains a pressing clinical challenge, particularly because of its resistance to conventional therapies and poor outcomes in advanced stages. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed as key molecular mediators in RCC, orchestrating critical pathways such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cellular proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Their roles in therapeutic resistance, including chemoresistance and radioresistance, further highlight their impact on treatment outcomes. Additionally, the potential of natural compounds such as curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol to target lncRNA-mediated pathways has garnered attention, offering insights into novel therapeutic strategies. This review examines the biogenic pathways and multifaceted functions of lncRNAs, shedding light on their influence on RCC pathophysiology and posttranscriptional regulation. In addition, this review emphasizes the repercussions of natural compounds as lncRNA-targeted therapies, thus offering a comprehensive perspective on emerging strategies that may lead to more effective and personalized treatments.",
