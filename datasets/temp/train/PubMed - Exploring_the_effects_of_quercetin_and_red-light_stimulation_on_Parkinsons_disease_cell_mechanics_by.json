  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that primarily impacts middle-aged and older adults. Despite advances in research, the underlying pathophysiology of PD is not fully understood. Although quercetin (Que) and other therapeutic agents show promise in reducing neuronal damage, and certain adjuvant treatments help improve patient recovery, there is no specific drug or treatment for PD. Recent studies have demonstrated that cell mechanical properties can be important indicators of cellular health, providing a new perspective for exploring PD pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a PD cell damage model to explore changes in the mechanical characteristics of PD cells before and after treatment with Que, as well as Que combined with red-light stimulation. Atomic force microscopy was employed to investigate these mechanical alterations. Furthermore, biological assays were carried out to elucidate the mechanisms by which these treatments inhibit cell damage, which provided a new approach for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of PD interventions.",
