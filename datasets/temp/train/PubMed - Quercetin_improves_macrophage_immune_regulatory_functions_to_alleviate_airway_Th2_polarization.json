  "abstract": "Th2 polarization is a central driver of allergic airway inflammation, yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying its dysregulation remain poorly defined. Quercetin is a bioactive flavonoid with immunomodulatory properties. This study investigates whether quercetin alleviates Th2-driven pathology in allergic airway inflammation by targeting IL-10 promoter hypermethylation in airway M2 macrophages.",
