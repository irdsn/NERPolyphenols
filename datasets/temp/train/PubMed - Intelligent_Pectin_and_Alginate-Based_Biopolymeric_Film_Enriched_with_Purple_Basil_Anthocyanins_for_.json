  "title": "Intelligent Pectin and Alginate-Based Biopolymeric Film Enriched with Purple Basil Anthocyanins for pH-Sensitive Detection of Chicken Meat Freshness.",
  "abstract": "Materials derived from renewable and natural resources, such as biopolymers, are increasingly favored over synthetic polymers in food packaging applications. Biopolymers integrated with bioactive compounds can eliminate the need for preservatives, providing nontoxic and safer alternatives. Furthermore, these biopolymers have the potential to facilitate real-time monitoring of food freshness through the incorporation of pH-sensitive natural extracts. In this study, a composite biopolymeric film was fabricated using alginate and pectin, with the film's properties further enhanced by the addition of purple basil extract. The film's indicator functionality was evaluated by monitoring the spoilage of skinless chicken breasts under refrigerated conditions. A visual color change was observed in the film, driven by the pH-sensitive properties of the purple basil extract, which corresponded with the progression of food spoilage. The resulting material presents a safe, edible, and cost-effective alternative to conventional packaging, paving the way for more sustainable and secure food packaging solutions.",
