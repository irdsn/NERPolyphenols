  "title": "Innovative Plant Exosome Delivery System for Enhancing Antiaging Potency on Skin.",
  "abstract": "Plant exosomes, small vesicles released by plant cells that contain various bioactive molecules, have garnered great attention for their potential applications in medicine, yet their delivery applications for skincare remain underexploited. Resveratrol (RES), renowned for its remarkable antiaging properties, faces challenges in transdermal absorption due to the stratum corneum barrier, hindering its efficacy. To address this, we developed a delivery system incorporating RES-loaded plant (Leontopodium alpinum) exosome (LEOEXO@RES). Evaluation through bothin vitroandin vivoexperiments demonstratedLEOEXO@RES's enhanced delivery of bioactive compounds and multifaceted skincare impact. Specifically, this approach not only promoted environmentally responsible waste reuse but also achieved harmonious synergy betweenLEOEXO carriers and RES, enhancing their overall efficacy. TheLEOEXO@RES effectively ameliorated inflammation levels and inhibited cellular senescence, highlighting its promising potential in antiaging skincare applications.",
