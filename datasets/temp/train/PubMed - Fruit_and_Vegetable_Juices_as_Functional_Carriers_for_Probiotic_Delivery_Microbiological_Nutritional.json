  "title": "Fruit and Vegetable Juices as Functional Carriers for Probiotic Delivery: Microbiological, Nutritional, and Sensory Perspectives.",
  "abstract": "Fermenting fruit and vegetable juices with probiotic bacteria is becoming a popular way to create functional drinks, offering an alternative to traditional dairy-based probiotic products. These plant-based juices are naturally rich in nutrients that help support the growth and activity of various probiotic strains. They also meet the rising demand for lactose-free, vegan, and clean-label options. This review looks at the key microbiological, nutritional, and sensory aspects of probiotic fermentation in juice. Common probiotic groups likeLactobacillus,Bifidobacterium,Lactococcus,Bacillus, andStreptococcusshow different abilities to adapt to juice environments, affecting properties such as antioxidant levels, shelf life, and taste. The review also explores how factors like pH, sugar levels, heating, and storage can influence fermentation results. New non-thermal processing methods that help maintain probiotic survival are also discussed. Since fermented juices can sometimes develop off-flavors, this paper looks at ways to improve their taste and overall consumer appeal. Finally, future directions are suggested, including personalized nutrition, synbiotic products, and advanced encapsulation technologies. Overall, probiotic fermentation of fruit and vegetable juices shows strong potential for developing a new generation of healthy and appealing functional foods.",
