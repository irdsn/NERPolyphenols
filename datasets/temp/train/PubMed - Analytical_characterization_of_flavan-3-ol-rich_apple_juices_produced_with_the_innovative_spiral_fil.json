  "abstract": "The retention of flavan-3-ols and other phenolic compounds during apple juice production at pilot plant scale (200 kg, cv. Boskoop) was investigated. An oxygen-excluding spiral filter press and a conventional decanter were used with and without pectinase mash treatment. Phenolic compounds were comprehensively identified and quantitated by RP-UHPLC and HILIC, both coupled to DAD-FLD and DAD-ESI(-)-QTOF-HR-MS/MS. These techniques combined with using a NIST cocoa flavan-3-ol standard allowed for the first time an individual quantification of flavan-3-ol fractions (DP 1-7) in apple juices. Spiral filter-pressed juices were exposed to less oxidation and exhibited four times higher total phenolic compound levels than decanter-made juices (1016 vs. 262 mg/L). Apple juices derived from pectinase-treated mashes had lower total phenolic compound levels than their non-treated counterparts. However, those made by spiral filter press still retained significantly higher concentrations (780 vs. 104 mg/L). Flavan-3-ols were especially well retained by spiral filter press processing, reaching unprecedentedly high concentrations of up to 713 mg/L. A 280 mL serving of non-treated spiral filter-pressed juice would therefore suffice to provide the daily intake of 200 mg flavan-3-ols, equaling the dose of cocoa flavan-3-ols associated with an authorized European health claim for healthy blood flow.",
