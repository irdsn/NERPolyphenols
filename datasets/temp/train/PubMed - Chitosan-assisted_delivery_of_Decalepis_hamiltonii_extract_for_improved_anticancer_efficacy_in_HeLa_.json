  "abstract": "The tuberous roots of Decalepis hamiltonii (D. hamiltonii) are a rich source of phenolic acids and flavonoids. Nanoencapsulation offers better drug delivery and enhances the bioavailability and stability of the bioactive compounds. In the current study, the cytotoxic ability of D. hamiltonii root extract-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (DHRE CS NPs) was investigated against HeLa cells. DLS analysis of DHRE CS NPs revealed the mean particle size (PS-245.4 ± 46.95 nm) and zeta potential (ZP-22.1 ± 13.7 mV). XRD and FTIR confirmed the amorphous nature and the successful encapsulation of DHRE. The SEM and HR-TEM analysis confirmed that the spherical-shaped particles are in the nano-range. The release studies revealed sustained release of around 96 % (pH 5.5) and 84 % (pH 7.4) up to 48 h. The MTT assay showed that DHRE CS NPs (IC50-30 μg/mL) are more effective against HeLa cells. The cellular uptake studies revealed increased fluorescent intensity with time, indicating their efficient internalization. The DHRE CS NPs efficiently induced oxidative stress as confirmed by elevated ROS generation (72 %), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP-43 %), induction of apoptosis (58 %), and cell cycle arrest. Our study suggests that DHRE CS NPs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer.",
