  "abstract": "Arazá (Eugenia stipitata) seeds, which are an abundant byproduct of pulp processing in the Amazon region, represent up to 84% of the fruit's dry matter and remain underutilized. This study investigates, for the first time, the bioactive potential of hydroethanolic (70:30) extracts from Arazá seeds (ASs) to inhibit key enzymes related to glycemic and cholesterol regulation, specificallyα-amylase,α-glucosidase, and HMG-CoA reductase. Additionally, the proximate characterization, antioxidant capacity assessment, and LC-MS analysis of phenolic compound composition were performed. The results demonstrated that the hydroethanolic extracts exhibited the significant inhibition ofα-amylase andα-glucosidase, with IC50values of 47.06 and 49.99 µg/mL, respectively. This inhibitory activity correlates with the total phenolic content (155.88 ± 6.12 mg GAE/g dry weight) and compounds such as epicatechin gallate andp-hydroxybenzoic acid. The extract also showed a high capacity to scavenge the DPPH radicals (IC50= 46.63 µg/mL), although no inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase or cytotoxicity in blood cells was observed. Proximate analysis revealed that ASs are low in lipids (0.16%), proteins (4.96%), and ash (0.82%) but contain a considerable amount of fiber (27.7%). These findings suggest that ASs represent a valuable byproduct with potential for further research on its application in diabetes management.",
