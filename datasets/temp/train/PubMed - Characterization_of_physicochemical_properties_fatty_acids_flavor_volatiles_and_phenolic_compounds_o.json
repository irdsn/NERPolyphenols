  "abstract": "A comprehensive investigation was done on 10 New Zealand-grown avocado (Persea americana Mill.) varieties to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics of their peel, seed, and pulp. Significant variability was identified in the physicochemical properties, phenolic and volatile profiles across the distinct parts and different varieties of avocados. A total of 88 terpenes and terpenoids, 22 alcohols, 22 aldehydes, 15 esters, and 9 ketones related to aromatic attributes of peels and seeds. The fatty acid composition of avocado varieties varied greatly; oleic acid predominated in avocado pulps and peels, while linoleic acid was the most abundant in avocado seeds. Nonanoic and pentadecanoic acids were tentatively detected in the avocado seed oil for the first time. Chlorogenic acid was the most prevalent phenolic compounds in all peels, whereas epicatechin had the highest concentrations in all seeds. Avocado byproducts were a substantial source of volatiles and bioactive compounds with potential food applications.",
