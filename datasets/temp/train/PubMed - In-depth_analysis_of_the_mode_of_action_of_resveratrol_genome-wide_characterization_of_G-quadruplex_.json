  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is one of the most studied and used biomolecules, for which many pharmacological effects targeting multiple tissues have been described. However, a common underlying mechanism driving its full pharmacological activity has not been described in detail. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures found in regulatory genomic locations and involved in controlling gene transcription, telomere maintenance, or genome stability, among others. This study provides a genome-wide characterization of RSV G4-binding properties, explaining its multi-target traits.",
