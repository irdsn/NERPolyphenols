  "abstract": "This study analyzes the effects on body composition and variables related to metabolic syndrome of two coffees with different degree of roasting and phenolic content. Sixty participants with body mass index between 25 and 35 kg/m2and a median age of 51.0 years (Interquartile range 46.3-56) were recruited. The study was a controlled, randomized, single-blind crossover trial consisting in drinking three cups/day of roasted coffee (RC) or lightly roasted coffee (LRC) during 12 weeks with 2-week wash-out stages before each coffee intervention. LRC contained ≈400 mg of hydroxycinnamic acids and ≈130 mg of caffeine per 200 mL/cup while RC contained ≈150 mg of hydroxycinnamic acids and ≈70 mg of caffeine per 200 mL/cup. Along the study, in each of the six visits, blood pressure, body composition by bioimpedance, anthropometric measurements, and blood biochemistry were analyzed. The mean differences andpvalues were calculated using a linear mixed model (JASP.v.0.18.0.3). A total of 38 participants completed the study. After the consumption of both coffees, fat mass and body fat percentage (LRC: -1.4%,p< 0.001; RC: -1.0%,p= 0.005) were reduced, whereas muscle mass and muscle mass percentage slightly increased (LRC: 0.8%,p< 0.001; RC: 0.7%,p= 0.002). The decrease in fat percentage was greater with LRC compared to RC (-0.8%;p= 0.029). There were no significant changes in metabolic syndrome variables or in body weight. In conclusion, LRC was slightly superior at inducing changes in body composition.",
