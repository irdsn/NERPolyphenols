  "abstract": "Background:Kukeya tablets (KYs), a traditional ethnic medicine prescription, are widely used to treat migraines and eye ailments in China. Despite their extensive clinical use, current knowledge on their therapeutic material basis is limited to a few major compounds, whereas certain minor ones have rarely been investigated. This study was conducted to screen and characterize the chemical components of KYs.Methods:A rapid and effective UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS method was established. A mass spectrometry qualitative analysis strategy for KYs was developed, including in-house library matching, accurate molecular mass and elemental composition matching, and MS/MS fragmentation rule elucidation.Results:In total, 144 compounds were identified in KYs, including 36 anthrones and anthraquinones, 36 chromones, 25 triterpenes, 12 resin glycosides, 12 phenylpyrones, 10 phenolic acids, 4 flavonoids, 2 lignans, and 7 others. Meanwhile, the identified compounds were effectively classified into nine chemical classes. Among them, 11 compounds were identified for the first time and the identities of 22 compounds were accurately confirmed using reference substances.Conclusions:The results obtained benefit the understanding of the therapeutic basis of KYs, significantly promote the quality control of KYs, and elucidate potential effective components of other traditional medicines.",
