  "title": "Chemical, Sensory Variations in Black Teas from Six Tea Cultivars in Jingshan, China.",
  "abstract": "The development of black tea quality is the outcome of the synergistic interaction between tea cultivars and the ecological environment of the production area, including factors such as climate, soil, and cultivation practices. Nevertheless, within a specific geographical region, systematic analysis of the environmental regulation mechanisms governing processing adaptability and quality formation among different cultivars remains insufficient. This study evaluated six Camellia sinensis cultivars from the Jingshan region of Hangzhou, China, integrating non-targeted metabolomics, sensory profiling, bioassays, and molecular docking to elucidate cultivar-specific quality attributes. Non-volatile metabolomics identified 84 metabolites linked to color and taste, including amino acids, catechins, flavonoid glycosides, and phenolic acids. Sensory and metabolite correlations revealed that amino acids enhanced brightness and imparted fresh-sweet flavors, while catechins contributed to bitterness and astringency. Specific metabolites, such as 4-hydroxybenzoyl glucose and feruloyl quinic acid, modulated color luminance. Volatile analysis identified 13 aroma-active compounds (OAV â‰¥ 1), with 1-octen-3-ol, phenylacetaldehyde, and linalool endowing JK with distinct floral-fruity notes. Molecular docking further demonstrated interactions between these volatiles and olfactory receptors (e.g., OR1A1 and OR2J2), providing mechanistic insights into aroma perception. These findings establish a robust link between cultivar-driven metabolic profiles in black tea, offering actionable criteria for cultivar selection and quality optimization in regional tea production.",
