  "abstract": "Cocoa flavanols (CFs) are polyphenolic molecules with proposed cardioprotective effects. Whilst extensive evidence supports their ability to ameliorate vasodilator responses within conduit vessels, their actions in the microvasculature are less clear. This systematic review of the literature aimed to determine whether CF interventions lead to improvements in microvascular vasodilator responses in healthy populations and those with increased cardiovascular disease risk.",
