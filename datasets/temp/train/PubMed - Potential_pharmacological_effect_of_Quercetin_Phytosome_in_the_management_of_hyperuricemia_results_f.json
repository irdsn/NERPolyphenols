  "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, and traditional treatments, such as xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors, often have limitations, such as severe hypersensitivity reactions or ineffectiveness in achieving target serum urate levels in some patients. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has shown potential as a hypouricemic agent through XO inhibition.",
