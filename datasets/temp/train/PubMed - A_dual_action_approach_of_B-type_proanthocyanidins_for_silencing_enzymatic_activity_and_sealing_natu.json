  "abstract": "This study explored the potential of dimeric and trimeric B-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) to silence dentin-associated enzymes as well as enhance sealing at the hybrid layer and in the underlying dentin of dentin-resin interfaces in both sound and natural caries-affected dentin (NCAD).",
