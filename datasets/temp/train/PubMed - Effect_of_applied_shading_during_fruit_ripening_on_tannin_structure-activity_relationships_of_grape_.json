  "abstract": "Historically, the effect of wine grape shading on flavonoids has investigated the impact of light incidence on proanthocyanidin (PA), flavonol, or anthocyanin concentration. In addition to concentration, the current experiment was designed to look at changes in PA composition, size and tannin activity through ripening. Tannin activity is a methodology for assessing the impact of structure and size on the affinity of tannin towards a hydrophobic surface and is considered to be a proxy for predicted astringency descriptive quality. In 2016 a shade cloth study was imposed on Cabernet Sauvignon on Mt Veeder, within the larger Napa Valley viticultural area. A control, which was unshaded, and two treatments consisting of 40% and 80% shade were applied at the onset of veraison.",
