  "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a universal reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic disorder. It affects 9.2% of women worldwide. Echinochrome (Ech) is the most common dark red pigment of sea urchin shells and possesses high antioxidant and hypoglycemic properties. Quercetin (Quer) is a flavonol widely distributed in plants with high antioxidant properties. Therefore, Ech and Quer as a combined protective therapy were investigated against letrozole and high-fat diet-induced PCOS model in rats.",
