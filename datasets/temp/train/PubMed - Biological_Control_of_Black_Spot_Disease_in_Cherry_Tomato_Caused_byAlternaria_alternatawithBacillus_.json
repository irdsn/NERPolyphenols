  "abstract": "Black spot is a major postharvest disease of cherry tomatoes, caused byAlternaria alternata. This causes economic losses and storage challenges, so researchers are exploring alternative methods. The biological control of fruits and vegetables using antagonistic bacteria and yeasts is currently a research hotspot. Initially, the biological control impact ofBacillus velezensisT3 on cherry tomato black spot was investigated. Disease defense, scavenging reactive oxygen species, and antioxidant-related enzymes were determined during different storage periods. The relative gene expressions of these enzymes were also confirmed using RT-qPCR. The results showed thatB. velezensisT3 reduced the incidence of black spot disease in cherry tomatoes. The growth ofA. alternatawas suppressed byB. velezensisT3 cell-free filtrate bothin vitroandin vivo. In addition,B. velezensisT3 induced the activities of disease resistance-related enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), Î²-1,3-glucanase (GLU), and chitinase (CHI), and the activities of the ROS-related enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and reduced the rate of O2-production and H2O2, and MDA content of cherry tomatoes. This approach offers a promising alternative for extending shelf life, though further studies are needed to fully characterize its effects on fruit quality.",
