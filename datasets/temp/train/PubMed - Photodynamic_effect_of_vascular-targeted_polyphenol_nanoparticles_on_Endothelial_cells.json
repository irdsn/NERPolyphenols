  "abstract": "Port wine stains (PWS) are vascular malformations, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment. Emerging drug delivery methods employ nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance drug permeability and retention in diseased blood vessels and improve drug bioavailability. (-) -epigallocatechin-3-gallate glycine (EGCG) has anti-angiogenetic effects and boosts photodynamic therapy. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) is capable of efficiently producing singlet oxygen, rendering it a very promising photosensitizer for utilization in nanomedicine.",
