  "abstract": "In Caucasians, regular consumption of cocoa induces a drop in arterial blood pressure via an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. However, black individuals have a different NO biodisponibility compared to Caucasians. The aim of this study was to determine, in black Africans, the physiological variations in arterial blood pressure among cocoa consumers.",
