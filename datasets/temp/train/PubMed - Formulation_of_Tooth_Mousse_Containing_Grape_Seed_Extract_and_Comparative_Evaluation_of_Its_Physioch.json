  "abstract": "The prevalence of total dental caries (untreated and treated) in primary or permanent teeth increases with age, going from 21.4, 50.5, and 53.8% among ages 2-5, 6-11, and 12-19, respectively. Dental caries is a dynamic process of demineralization and remineralization, and the use of various topical and systemic fluoride- and nonfluoride-based remineralizing agents can help replenish lost ions, promoting remineralization and further decreasing the prevalence of caries.",
