  "title": "Regulation of Natural Products on Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Diseases.",
  "abstract": "The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in both physiological and pathological conditions. Targeting molecules associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway presents a promising approach for disease treatment. The use of natural products in treating various diseases is widespread due to their favorable biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high biological activity. Research has shown that natural products such as curcumin and resveratrol can regulate multiple signaling pathways under disease conditions, including the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulatory mechanisms of natural products remain incompletely understood. This review aims to explore the regulatory effects of natural products on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in certain diseases, especially in the process of tumor progression. It outlines the composition and mechanisms of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, we predicted the potential binding sites of these natural products to this pathway, summarized the effects of diverse natural products on this signaling pathway, and conducted a preliminary exploration ofd the mechanisms of the effects of natural products. In addition, we considered and discussed the limitations of natural products, such as potential side effects from long-term use and the precision in targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This review provides a theoretical basis for the targeted strategy of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",
