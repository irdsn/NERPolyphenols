  "abstract": "The present study examined the impact of germination usingAloe veraas an elicitor on the phytochemical composition, antioxidant capacity, and in vitro anti-hyperglycemic and antitumoral activity of fenugreek seed extracts germinated by pressurizedn-propane. The lipid composition, free fatty acids, antioxidant activity, and phenolic content, as well as the contents of α-tocopherol, β-carotene, and minor compounds, have been determined for the extracts. The in vitro anti-hyperglycemic and anticancer activities were also evaluated in cervical cancer (HeLa) and colon cancer (SiHa) cell lines. Antioxidant activity increased two-fold, α-tocopherol increased almost three-fold, and β-carotene content was 55% higher in the germinated seed extracts compared to the raw. Fifteen polyphenolic compounds have been identified in fenugreek seed extracts, which promote germination by increasing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids at the expense of reducing saturated fatty acids. Extracts obtained from seed germination and elicitation withAloe verademonstrated potential in vitro anticancer activity in HeLa and SiHa cells. Fenugreek extracts demonstrated high in vitro inhibition of α-glucosidase (99%) and α-amylase (95%), indicating anti-hyperglycemic potential. The use ofAloe veragermination, combined with extraction using pressurizedn-propane, demonstrated efficiency in enriching fenugreek seed extracts with bioactive compounds with potential in vitro anti-hyperglycemic and antitumor activity.",
