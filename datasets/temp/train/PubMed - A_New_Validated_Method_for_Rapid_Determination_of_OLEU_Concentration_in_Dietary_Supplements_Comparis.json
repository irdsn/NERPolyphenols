  "title": "A New Validated Method for Rapid Determination of OLEU Concentration in Dietary Supplements: Comparison with Total Phenol Content and Antioxidant Activity.",
  "abstract": "The market for olive leaf dietary supplements is expanding rapidly and is valued at $437.15 million today. However, information on the control of these products is sketchy and the origin and variety of olives are rarely stated. The aim of this research was to validate a simple and rapid screening method for oleuropein determination in olive leaf dietary supplements. A matrix blank was prepared by removal of oleuropein from a mixture of dietary supplements and the matrix was then spiked with known concentrations to create a spiked matrix calibration curve in the range 5 - 40% oleuropein. Five replicate extractions and analyses of the matrix standards were carried out over 10â€‰days. Precision was less than 6% RSD and linearity was demonstrated by the Fischer test. Extraction recovery was > 90% and there was a strong linear relationship between authentic and matrix standards. All tested products conformed to the label claim which was strongly correlated with total polyphenols measured by the Folin-Ciocalteau method. Antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH assay and was found to be strongly correlated with total phenol content and oleuropein concentration.",
