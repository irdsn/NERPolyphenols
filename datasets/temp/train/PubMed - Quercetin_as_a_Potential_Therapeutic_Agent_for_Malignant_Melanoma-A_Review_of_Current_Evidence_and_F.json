  "title": "Quercetin as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Malignant Melanoma-A Review of Current Evidence and Future Directions.",
  "abstract": "Neoplastic disorders, particularly malignant carcinomas, are complex systemic diseases characterized by unregulated cellular proliferation, the invasion of adjacent tissues, and potential metastasis to distant bodily sites. Among the diverse spectrum of cancer subtypes, malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive form of cutaneous cancer originating in melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells resident in the skin. This malignancy is distinguished by its rapid and uncontrolled growth, as well as its propensity for metastasis to vital organs, thereby posing significant challenges to therapeutic intervention and prognostication. Early detection of melanoma is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes, as diagnosis at an advanced stage often yields a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Diagnostic modalities for melanoma encompass comprehensive clinical evaluations by dermatologists; radiological imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans; and excisional biopsies for accurate histopathological assessment. Malignant melanoma is typically treated with surgery to remove the tumor, followed by immunotherapy to enhance the immune response, targeted therapy for tumors with specific genetic mutations, chemotherapy for advanced stages, radiation therapy to manage metastasis, and other adjunct therapies. This review presents the properties and possible adjunct therapeutic effects against malignant melanoma of quercetin found in the literature and explores, based on the observed physicochemical properties and biological activity, its potential development as a topical formulation for cutaneous application. Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound abundant in various plant-based food sources, including apples, onions, berries, and citrus fruits, and has exhibited promising antiproliferative, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Its distinctive biochemical structure enables quercetin to effectively neutralize reactive oxygen species and modulate key carcinogenic pathways, thereby rendering it a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in managing malignant tumors, including melanoma.",
