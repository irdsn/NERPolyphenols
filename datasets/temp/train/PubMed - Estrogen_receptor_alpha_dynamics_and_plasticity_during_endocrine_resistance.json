  "abstract": "Breast cancer is subdivided into four distinct subtypes based on the status of hormone receptors (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as HER2-/HR+, HER2+/HR+, HER2+/HR-and HER2-/HR-. Among this, ERα positive breast cancer, even though they respond to endocrine treatment, half of the patients acquire resistance and progress with metastasis despite ERα status. Spatio-temporal changes in ERα and their loss under treatment pressure have been reported in a subset of patients, which is a serious problem.",
