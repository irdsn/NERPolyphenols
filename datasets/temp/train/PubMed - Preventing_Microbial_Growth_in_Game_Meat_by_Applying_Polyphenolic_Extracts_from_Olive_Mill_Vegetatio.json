  "abstract": "We studied the efficacy of different formulations of polyphenol extracts (mainly containing hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) from olive mill vegetation water on the microflora on the surfaces of game meat cuts with high or low initial bacterial loads. Meat with a high microbial load (>5 Log cfu/g; mean value = 6.83 ± 0.45 standard deviation) was immersed for 10 or 60 sec into 25% and 10% solutions of microencapsulated freeze-dried and non-encapsulated polyphenolic extracts. Aerobic colony,Enterobacteriaceae,Pseudomonasspp., and lactic acid bacteria counts were determined on treated samples compared to controls after 7 days of storage (in vacuum-packed conditions at +3 °C). Significant differences were registered only for aerobic colony count for a 10% liquid extract treatment (0.64 log reduction). In contrast, the dipping or immersion of game meat with low initial microbial loads (<5 Log cfu/g; mean value = 3.58 ± 0.72 standard deviation) in 10% solutions of the polyphenol extracts effectuated significant reductions in all bacteria counts (p< 0.002) at 7 and 14 days of storage for different extracts, independently from the application methods. The use of the extracts to inhibit bacterial growth in game meat should only be considered if a good hygienic baseline is guaranteed.",
