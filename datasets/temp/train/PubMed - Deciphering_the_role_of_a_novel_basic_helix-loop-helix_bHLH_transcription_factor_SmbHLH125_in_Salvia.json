  "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial in regulating secondary metabolic pathways, it is still a hot topic in drug mechanism research. However, the exploration and validation of its functions are far from sufficient. We presented the functional analysis of SmbHLH125, a novel bHLH transcription factor from Salvia miltiorrhiza. Overexpression of SmbHLH125 inhibited hairy root elongation, whereas knockout could grow normally, reduced rosmarinic acid levels, and increased salvianolic acid B and tanshinones. Muti-omics and yeast one-hybrid assays revealed that SmbHLH125 binds to the promoters of Sm4CL3 and SmHMGR1, key enzyme genes of biosynthesis pathway of phenolic acids and tanshinones respectively, and negatively regulates their expressions. It also binds to the promoters of SmAACT2, SmDXR and SmMK to positively regulates their expression. Moreover, we found that SmbHLH125 regulates a variety of functional phenolic acids and tanshinones. Therefore, we explored deeper that SmLAC7, CYP736A12 and CYP71AU50 might be potential enzymes genes for phenolic acid synthesis, and CYP736A12, CYP92B28, CYP71AU50, CYP97C28 and CYP71A6 may be catalase genes for tanshinone synthesis through gene-metabolite co-expression analysis. In conclusion, we have identified a new regulator with broad effects on secondary metabolism and provides a new perspective for analyzing and predicting gene functions.",
