  "abstract": "Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. While it is more commonly seen in children and adolescents, it accounts for about 1-2% of adult lymphomas. Since it has high Ki-67 ratios, both its progression rate and sensitivity to chemotherapy are high. However, treatment success decreases in chemotherapy-resistant relapsed/refractory groups. Therefore, new and less toxic therapeutic agents targeting biological pathways related to Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis are needed. In our study, we aimed to determine the antitumoral efficacy of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor ETP 45658 and antioxidant Resveratrol, which play a role in Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis on a Burkitt lymphoma cell line.",
