  "abstract": "Modern medication discovery is undergoing a paradigm change at the junction of herbal pharmacology with computational modeling informed by quantum theory. Herbal compounds, which have often been considered as complex and poorly understood entities, have historically been investigated using linear screening approaches and reductionist bioactivity models. A novel paradigm being presented in this work is herbal holography. Herbal molecules are seen by it as multi-dimensional systems best understood using holographic and quantum theories. As the pharmacological potential of plant-based compounds is under expanding research, more intricate integrated approaches are needed to grasp their bioactivities, predict their pharmacokinetics, and maximize drug lead optimization. The aim is to ascertain whether using quantum-driven methods results in a real revolution in herbal medicine or if it is really a pipe dream.",
