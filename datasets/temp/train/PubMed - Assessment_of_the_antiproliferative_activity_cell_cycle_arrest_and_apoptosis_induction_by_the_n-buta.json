  "abstract": "Asphodelus tenuifoliusCav. is well known in algerian folk medicine but its anticancer potential remains unexplored. This study examined the effects of then-butanolic fraction (BFAT) of its aerial part on cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were treated with BFAT (0-50.000 µg/mL) for 72 h, and cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle progression were analysed by flow cytometry after 24 h of treatment (250-1000 µg/mL). LC-HRMS/MS permitted the identification of 50 compounds with adenosine (19.01%), chlorogenic acid (13.76%), aloesin (10.13%) and hydroxysafflor Yellow A (7.39%) as the major components. BFAT demonstrated a strong antiproliferative activity (IC50:143.11 ± 6.43 µg/mL for PC3 and 149.19 ± 3.15 µg/mL for MDA-MB-231). It induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, reaching 80% apoptotic cells at 1000 µg/mL and caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Thus,A. tenuifoliusis a potential anticancer agent.",
