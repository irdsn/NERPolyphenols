  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in microorganisms is an escalating global concern, exacerbated by their formation of biofilms, which provide protection through an extracellular matrix and communication via quorum sensing, enhancing their resistance to treatment. This situation has driven the search for alternative approaches, particularly those using natural compounds. This study explores the potential of phytochemicals, such as quercetin, apigenin, arbutin, gallic acid, proanthocyanidins, and rutin, known for their antibacterial properties and ability to inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt mature biofilms. The methods used in this study included a comprehensive review of current literature assessing the bioavailability, distribution, and effective concentrations of these compounds in treating biofilm-associated infections. The results indicate that these phytochemicals exhibit significant antibacterial effects, reduce biofilm's structural integrity, and inhibit bacterial communication pathways. Moreover, their potential use in combination with existing antibiotics may enhance therapeutic outcomes. The findings support the conclusion that phytochemicals offer promising additions to anti-biofilm strategies and are capable of complementing or replacing conventional treatments, with appropriate therapeutic levels and delivery mechanisms being key to their effectiveness. This insight underscores the need for further research into their clinical applications for treating infections complicated by biofilms.",
