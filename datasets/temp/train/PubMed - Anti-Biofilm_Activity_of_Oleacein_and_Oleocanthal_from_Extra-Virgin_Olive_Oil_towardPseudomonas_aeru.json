  "abstract": "New antimicrobial molecules effective againstPseudomonas aeruginosa, known as an antibiotic-resistant \"high-priority pathogen\", are urgently required because of its ability to develop biofilms related to healthcare-acquired infections. In this study, for the first time, the anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities of a polyphenolic extract of extra-virgin olive oil as well as purified oleocanthal and oleacein, towardP. aeruginosaclinical isolates were investigated. The main result of our study was the anti-virulence activity of the mixture of oleacein and oleocanthal toward multidrug-resistant and intermediately resistant strains ofP. aeruginosaisolated from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia or surgical site infection. Specifically, the mixture of oleacein (2.5 mM)/oleocanthal (2.5 mM) significantly inhibited biofilm formation, alginate and pyocyanin production, and motility in bothP. aeruginosastrains (p< 0.05); scanning electron microscopy analysis further evidenced its ability to inhibit bacterial cell adhesion as well as the production of the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, our results suggest the potential application of the oleacein/oleocanthal mixture in the management of healthcare-associatedP. aeruginosainfections, particularly in the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance.",
