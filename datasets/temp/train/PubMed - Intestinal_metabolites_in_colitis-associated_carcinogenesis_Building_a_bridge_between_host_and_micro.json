  "abstract": "Microbial-derived metabolites are important mediators of host-microbial interactions. In recent years, the role of intestinal microbial metabolites in colorectal cancer has attracted considerable attention. These metabolites, which can be derived from bacterial metabolism of dietary substrates, modification of host molecules such as bile acids, or directly from bacteria, strongly influence the progression of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) by regulating inflammation and immune response. Here, we review how microbiome metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), secondary bile acids, polyamines, microbial tryptophan metabolites, and polyphenols are involved in the tumorigenesis and development of CAC through inflammation and immunity. Given the heated debate on the metabolites of microbiota in maintaining gut homeostasis, serving as tumor molecular markers, and affecting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in recent years, strategies for the prevention and treatment of CAC by targeting intestinal microbial metabolites are also discussed in this review.",
