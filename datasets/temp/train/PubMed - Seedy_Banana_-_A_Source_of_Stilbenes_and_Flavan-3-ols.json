  "abstract": "This study aimed at identifying the bioactive compounds in the seeds of three seedy banana varietiesMusa acuminata,Musa itinerans, andEnsete glaucum. GC-MS of extracts and NMR of isolated compounds were used for the identification of the components and GC-MS/FID was employed for quantification. The proportion of seeds in all samples was around 50% of the dried fruit weight. The seeds were rich in piceatannol, (+)-epiafzelechin, and epiafzelechin dimers. Piceatannol and epiafzelechin dimers were reported in seedy bananas for the first time. The highest piceatannol content was found inEnsete, accounting for 713 ± 71.9 mg/100 g dry weight (DW), followed by the seeds of ripeMusa acuminataandMusa itineransat 440 ± 56.7 and 242 ± 17.4 mg/100 g DW, respectively.Musaseeds with a higher content of piceatannol had lower concentrations of epiafzelechin and its dimers, in the ranges of 287 to 553 mg/100 g of DW and 533 to 976 mg/100 g of DW, respectively. The content depended on maturity. Compared with ripe fruits, greenMusascontained hardly any piceatannol and higher levels of epiafzelechin dimers. Gallocatechin was detected only inEnsete glaucumat 145 ± 19.7 mg/100 g of DW, and a major part of the phenolic compounds in g was found in the seed coat. The identified phenolic compounds in the seeds suggest that seedy bananas could be a potential new crop for food supplements.",
