  "title": "From Field to Waste Valorization: A Preliminary Study Exploring the Impact of the Wine Supply Chain on the Phenolic Profile of Three Sardinian Pomace Extracts.",
  "abstract": "The winemaking process generates an annual global production of about 10 million tons of waste consisting of stalks, skin, and seeds. The possible reutilization of wine pomace is strictly linked to its chemical composition. In this preliminary study, three different Sardinian white grapes (Malvasia, Vermentino and Nasco) grown in the same area were evaluated through a whole wine production chain. To reduce environmental impact, all the grapes were treated following the integrated production practice (IPP) strategies. The adopted agronomic methods and the main physico-chemical parameters of the fresh fruits and musts were evaluated. A fully qualitative and quantitative characterization of the phenolic fraction of the pomace extracts was performed by HPLC-DAD after a post-winemaking process. Water and ethanol were utilized as green solvents in the extraction process. Additionally, the entire pomace post-winemaking process was carried out within the winery facilities to reduce energy loss and road transportation. The findings demonstrated that large amounts of beneficial polyphenols are present in pomace extracts, and that the type of grape used, agronomic practices, and winemaking method all influence the quantity and quality of the extracts. The polyphenol concentrations in the Vermentino (28,391.5 ± 7.0 mg/kg) and Malvasia pomace (11,316.3 ± 6.5 mg/kg) were found to be the highest and lowest, respectively.",
