  "title": "Targeting Molecular Pathways in Breast Cancer Using Plant-Derived Bioactive Compounds: A Comprehensive Review.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases worldwide, affecting millions of individuals and their families. While current treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies have improved survival rates, they often come with severe side effects and limitations. This has led to a growing interest in natural compounds derived from medicinal plants as safer and potentially more effective alternatives. These plant-based compounds have shown promise in targeting key cancer pathways, including EGFR, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, NF-ÎºB, JAK-STAT3, RAF/MEK/ERK, BCL-2, p53, and SKP/p21, helping to inhibit tumor growth, induce cancer cell death, and prevent metastasis. Research combining computational, in vitro, and in vivo studies has revealed that bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and phenolics can provide meaningful therapeutic benefits. However, challenges such as ensuring proper absorption, stability, and clinical application remain. By addressing these limitations through advanced drug formulations and integration into existing treatment plans, plant-based therapies could play a vital role in improving outcomes for breast cancer patients. This review sheds light on the potential of natural compounds to offer hope for more effective and less harmful cancer treatments in the future.",
