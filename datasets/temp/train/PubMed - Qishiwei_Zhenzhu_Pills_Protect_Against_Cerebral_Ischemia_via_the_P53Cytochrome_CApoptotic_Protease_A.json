  "abstract": "Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills (QSWZZP, Tibetan name: ) originated from Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu mother pills in the eighth century AD and are currently included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020). QSWZZP calm the mind, activate the medians, regulate qi, and harmonize the blood. QSWZZP have significant therapeutic effects in cerebral ischemia. However, QSWZZP's complex and diverse multi-herb chemical composition has presented challenges in identifying their active ingredients, which have hitherto remained unclarified. Therefore, the present study focusses on the identification of QSWZZP's active ingredients and their therapeutic mechanisms.",
