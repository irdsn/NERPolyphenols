  "abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is investigated as an electrolyte additive to achieve superior stability for zinc anodes. This trace molecular additive not only alters the solvation structure but also forms an interfacial molecular layer that continuously protects the zinc anode during repeated cycles. As a result, this leads to an extended cycle life (5340 h) and high coulombic efficiency (99.76%) in (a)symmetric zinc cells, while also enhancing the performance of full cells.",
