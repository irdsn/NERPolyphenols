  "title": "Study on plant-based proteins and their complexes in improving food foam system: A review.",
  "abstract": "The unique hollow structure of foam confers appealing sensory qualities and visual appeal to food products while delivering a desirable texture. Recently, the development of green and healthy food-grade foam improvers has become a research priority for food foam systems. Plant-based proteins with typical amphiphilic structures have attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers owing to their excellent surface activity, naturalness and sustainability. Current strategies frequently employ polysaccharides and polyphenols to interact with plant-based proteins, forming binary or ternary complexes that markedly enhance foam stability and functional performance. Therefore, this paper reviewed the mode of formation, classification criteria, destabilization mechanisms and application scope of food foams. Additionally, we also summarized the types of interaction between the components of plant-based protein complexes, as well as the mechanisms and commonly used characterization methods for improving foam stability. Finally, the research deficiencies and future prospects of plant-based protein complexes in improving food foam systems are noted. This review provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for the development of efficient and green food foam stabilizers.",
