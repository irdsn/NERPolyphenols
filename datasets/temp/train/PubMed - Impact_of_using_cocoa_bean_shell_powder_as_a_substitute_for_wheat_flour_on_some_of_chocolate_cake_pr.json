  "title": "Impact of using cocoa bean shell powder as a substitute for wheat flour on some of chocolate cake properties.",
  "abstract": "The cocoa bean shell is a residue rich in bioactive compounds and its use as an ingredient in the food industry has been studied. This work had the objective of proposing the elaboration of chocolate cake with substitution of wheat flour by cocoa bean shell powder (CSp). Five formulations with different percentages of CSp were used: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% and 0% (control). The cakes were evaluated by technological characteristics (volume, texture profile, firmness and colour), antioxidant profile (DPPH, Î²-carotene/linoleic acid system, phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and tannins) and sensory tests (TDS and acceptance). The technological characteristics and antioxidant activity of the cakes were influenced by the different concentrations of CSp compared to the control sample. The cakes containing up to 75% CSp presented satisfactory sensory acceptance. Therefore, CSp has been revealed to be a prominent alternative substitute ingredient to be used promisingly in the food industry.",
