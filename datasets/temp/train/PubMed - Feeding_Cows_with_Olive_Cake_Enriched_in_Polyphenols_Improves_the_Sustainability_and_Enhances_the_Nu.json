  "abstract": "In this study, Caciocavallo, a typical cheese produced in Sicily Island (Italy), was obtained from the milk of dairy cows fed with and without enriched olive cake (ECO and CTR, respectively) in order to evaluate nutritional, microbiological, volatile, and sensory differences in cheeses. ECO cheese showed greater (p< 0.05) MUFA and PUFA and polyphenols content and lower SFA content than CTR cheese. Microbiological analyses revealed the absence of Salmonella,Listeria monocytogenes,Escherichia coli, andE. coliO157, and no significant differences in the viable counts of the remaining microbial groups analyzed, between samples. Thermophilic lactococci were more prevalent in ECO cheese. The implementation of a culture-independent method, such as PCR-DGGE analyses, revealed the presence of a more diverse microbial population in both cheeses. Regarding the volatile compounds profile, long-chain free fatty acids were more abundant in the ECO cheese, resulting in a healthier free fatty acid profile. This study also showed that, especially for their appearance and taste, consumers mostly appreciated the ECO cheese. The results show that using enriched olive cake could enhance the sustainability and the quality of Ragusano cheese, improving not only the health of its consumers but also positively influencing tastes and acceptability.",
