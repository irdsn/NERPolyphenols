  "title": "Resveratrol Prevents Weight Gain, Counteracts Visceral Adipose Tissue Dysfunction, and Improves Hypothalamic Leptin Sensitivity in Diet-Induced Obese Rats.",
  "abstract": "In obesity, increased adipocyte size is associated with metabolic complications, while elevated adipocyte numbers are considered a protective mechanism against metabolic disturbances. Adipose tissue dysfunction leads to decreased leptin sensitivity and disrupted energy balance regulation. Resveratrol (RSV), a bioactive compound known for potential health benefits, including obesity-related disorder prevention, has unclear modulatory effects on adipocyte dysfunction and leptin signaling in established obesity. This study investigated the impact of RSV on adiposity and hypothalamic leptin sensitivity in obesity. Rats were fed a cafeteria diet for 9 weeks and subsequently supplemented with different doses of RSV for 22 days. The 200Â mg/kg RSV dose reduced leptin concentrations, body weight gain, and body fat mass in obese animals, while mitigating adipocyte hypertrophy and promoting adipocyte hyperplasia in the retroperitoneal fat depot. RSV also improved hypothalamic leptin sensitivity, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the benefits of RSV consumption for obesity-related disorders.",
