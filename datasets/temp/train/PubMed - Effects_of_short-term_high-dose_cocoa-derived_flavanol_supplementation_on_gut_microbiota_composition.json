  "abstract": "Cocoa-derived flavanols (CDF) may act as prebiotics. However, evidence is inconsistent, and the duration and dose of CDF intake needed to elicit any prebiotic effect are undefined. This randomized, double-blind, crossover study determined the effects of short-term, high-dose dietary supplementation with CDF versus matched placebo on gut microbiota composition in 8 healthy adults. A single faecal sample was collected 8 d after supplementation with 900 mg/d CDF or placebo. Gut microbiota composition andBifidobacteriumspp. andLactobacillusspp. abundance were measured as secondary outcomes by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. No between-treatment differences in the relative or absolute abundance ofBifidobacteriumspp. (Cohen'sd= 0.89,P= 0.22) orLactobacillusspp. (Cohen'sd= 0.42,P= 0.65) were detected. Shannon diversity (Cohen'sd= 0.38,P= 0.04) and overall community richness (Cohen'sd= 0.34,P= 0.06) were lower following CDF supplementation versus placebo, but no between-treatment differences in Î²-diversity or taxa relative abundances were observed. Findings are not consistent with a clear prebiotic effect of this short-term, high-dose CDF supplementation strategy relative to placebo.",
