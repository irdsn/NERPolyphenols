  "abstract": "Stropharia rugosoannulataandMacrolepiota procerahave garnered considerable attention due to their distinctive flavor profile, culinary versatility, and potential nutritional and therapeutic benefits. They are a rich source of high-quality protein, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, contributing to daily nutritional requirements and promoting overall well-being. Furthermore, they contain a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, flavonoids, and triterpenoids, which have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties in previous studies. However, comprehensive reviews focusing on these two species remain limited. Therefore, this review summarizes the types of nutrients and bioactive compounds found inStropharia rugosoannulataandMacrolepiota procera, along with their respective extraction methods. Moreover, the bioactivities of these compounds were discussed, aiming to provide a theoretical framework for the development of novel functional foods and nutraceuticals derived fromStropharia rugosoannulataandMacrolepiota procera.",
