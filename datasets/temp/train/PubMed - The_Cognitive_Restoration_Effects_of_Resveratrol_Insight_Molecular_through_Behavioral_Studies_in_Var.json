  "title": "The Cognitive Restoration Effects of Resveratrol: Insight Molecular through Behavioral Studies in Various Cognitive Impairment Models.",
  "abstract": "Cognition is essential for daily activities and progressively deteriorates with age due to various factors leading to cognitive decline. This decline often begins with memory impairment and advances to broader cognitive dysfunctions. Resveratrol (RES), a natural phenolic compound found in red wine, has garnered significant attention for its potential to prevent cognitive decline. This review aims to synthesize the latest preclinical data on the cognitive restorative effects of RES. We highlight RES activities from cellular mechanisms to behavioral outcomes. Evidence from various cognitive impairment models demonstrates that RES exerts neuroprotective effects through multiple mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neurotrophic actions, all of which contribute to cognitive enhancement in behavioral studies. Despite the established role of RES in mitigating memory decline, our review identifies a critical gap in behavioral studies regarding cognitive flexibility. Further research in this domain is recommended. Additionally, species-specific pharmacokinetic differences may account for the inconsistencies between preclinical and clinical outcomes, particularly in rats and humans. We propose that formulations designed to delay gut metabolism through enterohepatic circulation could enhance the translational potential of RES. Furthermore, long-term studies are needed to determine the optimal dose capable of maximizing health benefits without raising toxicity during chronic use.",
