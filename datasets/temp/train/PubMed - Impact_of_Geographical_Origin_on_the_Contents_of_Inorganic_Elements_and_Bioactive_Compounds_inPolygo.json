  "title": "Impact of Geographical Origin on the Contents of Inorganic Elements and Bioactive Compounds inPolygonum perfoliatumL.",
  "abstract": "This study investigated the correlation between thirteen inorganic elements, five key bioactive compounds, and environmental factors inPolygonum perfoliatumL. from fifteen different origins. Analyses were conducted using techniques such as ultrasound-assisted extraction, HPLC, ICP-AES, PCA, and HCA. The results indicate that the geographical origin significantly influences the contents of inorganic elements and bioactive compounds inPolygonum perfoliatumL., and a certain correlation exists among elements, compounds, and environmental factors. This research provides a theoretical foundation for the development and utilization ofPolygonum perfoliatumL.",
