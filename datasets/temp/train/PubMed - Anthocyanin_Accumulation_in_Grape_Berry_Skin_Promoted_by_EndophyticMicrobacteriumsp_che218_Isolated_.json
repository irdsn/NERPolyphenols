  "abstract": "Grape berry skin coloration is a key determinant of the commercial value of red wines. Global warming caused by climate change has inhibited anthocyanin biosynthesis in berry skins, leading to poor coloration. Through two-year field experiments, the endophyte che218 isolated from grape shoot xylem promoted anthocyanin accumulation in berry skins. The che218 enhanced anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine cultured cells. In the 2022 growing season, applying che218 to grape bunches enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in berry skins on day 20 post-treatment. However, the anthocyanin accumulation enhancing effect of che218 became negligible at harvest. In the 2023 growing season, che218 enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in berry skins on day 15 post-treatment and at harvest (day 30 post-treatment) and also upregulated the transcription ofmybA1andUFGT, two genes that regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in berry skins. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated that che218 is an unidentifiedMicrobacteriumspecies. However, it remains unknown how che218 is involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin in berry skins. This study provides insights into the development of an eco-friendly endophyte-mediated technique for improving grape berry skin coloration, thereby mitigating the effects of global warming on berry skin coloration.",
