  "abstract": "Mulberry extracts can reduce postprandial blood glucose (PPG) and insulin (PPI) responses by slowing rates of glucose uptake following carbohydrate-rich meals. The presumed mechanism is the inhibition of intestinal alpha-glucosidase, mainly attributed to 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) in the extracts. However, other components including other iminosugars or polyphenols might also contribute to these effects.",
