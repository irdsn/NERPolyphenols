  "abstract": "Soil-borne fungal pathogens such asSclerotiumspp.,Rhizoctoniaspp., andMacrophominaspp. pose significant threats to global agriculture, with soybean crops among the most severely affected due to damping-off disease. These pathogens cause substantial yield losses, making their management a critical concern. In this study, we investigated the potential ofBacillus siamensisBCL, a novel Neotropical strain, as an eco-friendly solution for managingSclerotium,Rhizoctonia, andMacrophominaspecies. The strain exhibited strong antifungal activity, significantly inhibiting fungal growth in vitro, with the greatest suppression observed againstMacrophominaspp., reaching up to 81%. In vivo assays further confirmed the biocontrol potential ofB. siamensis. When applied at 106colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, the strain reduced disease symptoms and improved plant growth parameters-including root length, shoot biomass, and leaf number-compared to untreated, infected controls. The protective effect varied by pathogen, with the most significant recovery in root length observed againstMacrophominaspp. (85%) andSclerotiumspp. (78%). In preventive treatments, fermentation extracts of theB. siamensisstrain suppressed disease progression, although they did not promote seedling growth. A genomic analysis ofB. siamensisBCL revealed genes encoding antimicrobial secondary metabolites, including terpenes, fengycins, and surfactins. These findings highlightB. siamensisBCL as a promising candidate for sustainable crop protection and a valuable resource for developing novel antimicrobial strategies in agriculture.",
