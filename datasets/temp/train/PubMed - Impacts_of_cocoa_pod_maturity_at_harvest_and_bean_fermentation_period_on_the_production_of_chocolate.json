  "abstract": "Cacao beans are rich sources of polyphenols with an abundance of flavonoids and methylxanthines that have positive influences on human health. The main factors affecting the formation of flavor as well as the chemical and bioactive composition of cacao beans are cacao pod maturity and post-harvest fermentation. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of pod harvest maturity (mature and ripe) and post-fermentation period (1, 3, and 5â€‰days in a controlled temperature environment) measured by pre-harvest maturity indices, post-harvest quality tests, chemical measurements, and organoleptic evaluation.",
