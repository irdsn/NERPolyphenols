  "abstract": "Three new dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, namely, kadcolignan H-J (1-3), were isolated from the ethanol extract ofKadsura coccineafruits. Their molecular structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated through comprehensive spectroscopic analyses. The hepatoprotective effects of kadcolignan H-J (1-3)were subsequently evaluated. Both kadcolignan H (1)and kadcolignan J(3)demonstrated inhibitory effects on triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, whereas all isolated compounds effectively reduced the levels of free fatty acids-induced reactive oxygen species in HepG2 cells.",
