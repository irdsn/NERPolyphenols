  "abstract": "The present review explores the influence of the gut microbiota on antibiotic resistance dynamics, particularly those associated with dysbiosis. The improper use of antibiotics can induce resistance in pathogens through various pathways, which is a topic of increasing interest within the scientific community. This review highlights the importance of microbial diversity, gut metabolism, and inflammatory responses against the dysbiosis due to the action of antibiotics. Additionally, it examines how secondary metabolites secreted by pathogens can serve as biomarkers for the early detection of antibiotic resistance. Although significant progress has been made in this field, key research gaps persist, including the need for a deeper understanding of the long-term effects of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and the specific mechanisms driving the evolution of resistance in gut bacteria. Based on these considerations, this review systematically analyzed studies from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus up to July 2024. This study aimed to explore the dynamics of the interactions between gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance, specifically examining how microbial composition influences the development of resistance mechanisms. By elucidating these relationships, this review provides insights into management strategies for drug resistance and improves our understanding of microbial contributions to host health.",
