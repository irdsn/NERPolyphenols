  "abstract": "To study the role of infrared (IR) radiation in the color change of the grape berry, field screening (IR-) and in vitro culture irradiation (IR+) were used. Acylated anthocyanin biosyntheses, including the biosynthesis of malvidin 3-O-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and their derivatives (acetylation andp-coumaroylation), were inhibited by IR-. IR+ promoted the biosynthesis of malvidin 3-O-glucoside and its derivatives, and IR+ inhibited the biosynthesis of peonidin 3-O-glucoside and its derivatives. WGCNA analysis revealed that the red module positively correlated with the flavonoid pathway. The hub genes were related to the anthocyanin pathway, includingVvF3'5'H,VvANS,VvOMT1,VIT_18s0001g09400, andVvGST4. Further, the results revealed that transcription factors like RLK-Pelle, MYB, and C2H2 families were involved in response to IR radiation. Therefore, these results provide a complete understanding of IR radiation in grape skin color formation and the prospect of using supplemental light to improve the overall color of berries.",
