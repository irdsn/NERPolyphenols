  "title": "Plasma and ultrasound-treated cashew apple juices: An NMR analysis approach of its sugars, amino and organic acids.",
  "abstract": "Cashew apple juice is a beverage derived from the peduncles of the cashew fruit (Anacardium occidentale). It is a nutrient-dense juice containing vitamins, organic acids, phenolics, carotenoids, amino acids, and sugars. Thermal processing darkens the juice, reducing its appeal, while non-thermal processing preserves its visual appeal but may lead to changes in its chemical composition. In this study, we evaluate the effects of plasma and ultrasound processing on the concentration of sugars, organic, and amino acids in cashew apple juice, analysing them by NMR technique. Experimental designs were planned to map each process's main operating conditions range. Processing the juice with plasma has the advantage of preserving its natural chemical characteristics while boosting the amino acid content. Meanwhile, ultrasound processing reduces the juice's sugar content by up to 21Â %, offering the potential to create lower-calorie cashew apple juice without compromising its natural sweetness and sourness.",
