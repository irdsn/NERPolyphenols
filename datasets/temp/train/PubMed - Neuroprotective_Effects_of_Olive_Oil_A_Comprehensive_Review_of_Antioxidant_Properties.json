  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a significant challenge to global healthcare, and oxidative stress plays a crucial role in their development. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the neuroprotective potential of olive oil, with a primary focus on its antioxidant properties. The chemical composition of olive oil, including key antioxidants, such as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and oleocanthal, is systematically examined. The mechanisms by which these compounds provide neuroprotection, including counteracting oxidative damage and modulating neuroprotective pathways, are explored. The neuroprotective efficacy of olive oil is evaluated by synthesizing findings from various sources, including in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical trials. The integration of olive oil into dietary patterns, particularly its role in the Mediterranean diet, and its broader implications in neurodegenerative disease prevention are also discussed. The challenges in translating preclinical findings to clinical applications are acknowledged and future research directions are proposed to better understand the potential of olive oil in mitigating the risk of neurodegenerative conditions. This review highlights olive oil not only as a dietary component, but also as a promising candidate in preventive neurology, advocating for further investigation in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.",
