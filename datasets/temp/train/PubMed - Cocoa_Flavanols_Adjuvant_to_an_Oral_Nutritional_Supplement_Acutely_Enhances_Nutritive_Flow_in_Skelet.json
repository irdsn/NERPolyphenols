  "abstract": "Ageing is associated with postprandial muscle vascular and metabolic dysfunction, suggesting vascular modifying interventions may be of benefit. Reflecting this, we investigated the impact of acute cocoa flavanol (450-500 mg) intake (versus placebo control) on vascular (via ultrasound) and glucose/insulin metabolic responses (via arterialised/venous blood samples and ELISA) to an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) in twelve healthy older adults (50% male, 72 ± 4 years), in a crossover design study. The cocoa condition displayed significant increases inm. vastus lateralismicrovascular blood volume (MBV) in response to feeding at 180 and 240-min after ONS consumption (baseline: 1.00 vs. 180 min: 1.09 ± 0.03,p= 0.05; 240 min: 1.13 ± 0.04,p= 0.002), with MBV at these timepoints significantly higher than in the control condition (p< 0.05). In addition, there was a trend (p= 0.058) for MBV inm. tibialis anteriorto increase in response to ONS in the cocoa condition only. Leg blood flow and vascular conductance increased, and vascular resistance decreased in response to ONS (p< 0.05), but these responses were not different between conditions (p> 0.05). Similarly, glucose uptake and insulin increased in response to ONS (p< 0.05) comparably between conditions (p> 0.05). Thus, acute cocoa flavanol supplementation can potentiate oral feeding-induced increases in MBV in older adults, but this improvement does not relay to muscle glucose uptake.",
