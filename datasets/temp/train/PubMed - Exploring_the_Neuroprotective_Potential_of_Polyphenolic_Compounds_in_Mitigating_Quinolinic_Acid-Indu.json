  "abstract": "Quinolinic Acid (QA), a neurotoxic metabolite in the kynurenine pathway, contributes to neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, playing a key role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of polyphenolic compounds, particularly lycopene and a Curcumin-Zinc (Cur-Zn) complex, using in- -silico and in-vitro approaches targeting the kynurenine pathway.",
