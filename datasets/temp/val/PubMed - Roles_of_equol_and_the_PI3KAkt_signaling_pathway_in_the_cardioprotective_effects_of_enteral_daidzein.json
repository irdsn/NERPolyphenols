  "abstract": "Daidzein, a soy-derived phytoestrogen, administered directly in the heart does not show cardioprotective effects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in isolated rat hearts. This study aimed to investigate whether cardioprotective effects of enteral daidzein against myocardial IR are promoted by equol, a metabolite of daidzein, through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway.",
