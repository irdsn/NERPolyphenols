  "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are defined as a kind of diseases closely related to bad behaviors and lifestyles, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. Driven by population growth and aging, NCDs have become the biggest disease burden in the world, and it is urgent to prevent and control these chronic diseases. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that degrade cellular senescent or malfunctioning organelles in lysosomes. Mounting evidence has demonstrated a major role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other major human diseases, suggesting that autophagy could be a candidate therapeutic target for NCDs. Natural products/phytochemicals are important resources for drugs against a wide variety of diseases. Recently, compounds from natural plants, such as resveratrol, curcumin, and ursolic acid, have been recognized as promising autophagy modulators. In this review, we address recent advances and the current status of the development of natural autophagy modulators in NCDs and provide an update of the latest in vitro and in vivo experiments that pave the way to clinical studies. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between natural autophagy modulators and NCDs, with an intent to identify natural autophagy modulators with therapeutic potential.",
