  "abstract": "Introduction: COVID-19 has been associated with dyslipidemia and altered markers of lipid peroxidation, which may increase the risk of progression to severe forms of the disease. While viral infections such as COVID-19 can adversely affect lipid profiles, dietary polyphenol intake may improve lipid parameters and mitigate complications.Objective: To investigate the relationship between polyphenol intake, lipid profile, and lipid peroxidation markers in patients with COVID-19.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 154 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time RT-PCR, recruited from two primary care units in Teresina, Brazil. Nutritional status and waist circumference were assessed according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides (TG) were measured to assess lipid profile. Polyphenol intake was estimated using two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls and the Phenol-Explorer 3.6 database. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was assessedviathe thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured byo-dianisidine oxidation.Results: Most participants were male (55.8%) with a mean BMI of 26.60 kg m-2. Polyphenol intake â‰¥1000 mg day-1was associated with desirable TC levels. The average intake was 1202.59 mg day-1, with flavonoids being the predominant class. Major dietary sources included beans, couscous, and coffee. Flavone intake was inversely correlated with TC and LDL-c levels, while flavanone intake was positively correlated with MPO activity.Final considerations: The consumption of total polyphenols, particularly flavones, was associated with a better lipid profile, suggesting a potential cardiovascular protection and, consequently, a reduction in COVID-19 complications.",
