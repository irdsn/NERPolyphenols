  "title": "Unveiling the Role of Sweet Potato Root in Skin Health: A New Approach to Collagen Synthesis and Rejuvenation.",
  "abstract": "Collagen synthesis is inextricably linked to skin health and is necessary for maintaining the skin's suppleness, structure, and general youthfulness. Wrinkles and loss of skin firmness are due to a reduction in collagen synthesis with age. The interest in dermatology lies in natural substances that promote collagen synthesis and prevent skin aging. Rich in bioactive compounds such as beta-carotene, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, the root of sweet potato could be seen to offer the potential to enhance skin health. The review paper discusses the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the root that protect the skin from oxidative stress and inflammation and delves into its use as a natural collagen formation and rejuvenation agent for the skin. Such in vitro and in vivo experiments and clinical studies provided experimental data on the effectiveness of this food supplement in skin health and collagen production. In addition, this review explored the role of natural sweet potato root, for instance, through the mechanism of sweet potato extract containing resveratrol in promoting skin health. This opens a chance for discussing the implications that supplements from the root of the sweet potato might make if orally administered and applied topically to improve health conditions for the skin.",
