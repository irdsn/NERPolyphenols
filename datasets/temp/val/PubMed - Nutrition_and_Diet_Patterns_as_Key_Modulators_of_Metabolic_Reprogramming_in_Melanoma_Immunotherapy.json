  "abstract": "Background: Melanoma, one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, has seen significant therapeutic advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, many patients fail to respond or develop resistance, creating the need for adjunct strategies.Objective: The objective of this study is to critically evaluate how specific dietary patterns and nutrient-derived metabolites modulate melanoma metabolism and immunotherapy outcomes, emphasizing translational implications.Methods: We performed an integrative review of preclinical and clinical studies investigating dietary interventions in melanoma models and ICI-treated patients. Mechanistic insights were extracted from studies on nutrient transport, immunometabolism, and microbiome-immune interactions, including data from ongoing nutritional clinical trials.Results: Diets rich in fermentable fibers, plant polyphenols, and unsaturated lipids, such as Mediterranean and ketogenic diets, seem to contribute to the reprogramming of tumor metabolism and enhance CD8+ T-cell activity. Fasting-mimicking and methionine-restricted diets modulate T-cell fitness and tumor vulnerability via nutrient stress sensors (e.g., UPR, mTOR). High fiber intake correlates with favorable gut microbiota and improved ICI efficacy, while excess protein, methionine, or refined carbohydrates impair immune surveillance via lactate accumulation and immunosuppressive myeloid recruitment. Several dietary molecules act as network-level modulators of host and microbial proteins, with parallels to known drug scaffolds.Conclusions: Integrating dietary interventions into melanoma immunotherapy can significantly influence metabolic reprogramming by targeting metabolic vulnerabilities and reshaping the tumor-immune-microbiome axis. When combined with AI-driven nutrient-protein interaction mapping, this approach offers a precision nutrition paradigm that supports both physicians and patients, emerging as a novel layer to enhance and consolidate existing therapeutic strategies.",
