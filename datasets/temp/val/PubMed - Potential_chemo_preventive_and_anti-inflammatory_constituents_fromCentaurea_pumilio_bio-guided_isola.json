  "abstract": "The natural alternatives offer cost-effective solutions compared to chemically synthesised drugs, with the added advantage of minimal side effects.Centaurea pumilioL., a rare and endangered species within theCentaureagenus belonging to the Asteraceae family, has received limited attention regarding its chemical composition. Aerial parts ofC. pumiliowere extracted with methanol (TE-1) and then fractionated into four fractions as follows (DCM-2, WF-3, MW-4 and MF-5). In a rigorous assessment of their anti-inflammatory potential, all samples underwent scrutiny utilising LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages. Notably, the dichloromethane fraction (DCM-2) showcased a pronounced anti-inflammatory efficacy, thus establishing them as compelling natural substitutes for synthetic anti-inflammatory medications. Our comprehensive phytochemical investigation of this bioactive fraction resulted in the isolation and identification of four compounds, namelyβ-sitosterol, stigmasterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, stigmast-1,5-dien-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and lupeol. Notably, none of the compounds exhibited any cytotoxic effects. Finally,Centaureacould be considered an anti-inflammatory candidate for the amelioration of enduring health challenges.",
