  "abstract": "In this study, the antifungal potential of chemical constituents fromPiper pesaresanumand some synthesized derivatives was determined against three phytopathogenic fungi associated with the cocoa crop. The methodology included the phytochemical study on the aerial part ofP. pesaresanum, the synthesis of some derivatives and the evaluation of the antifungal activity against the fungiMoniliophthora roreri,Fusarium solaniandPhytophthorasp. The chemical study allowed the isolation of three benzoic acid derivatives (1-3), one dihydrochalcone (4) and a mixture of sterols (5-7). Seven derivatives (8-14) were synthesized from the main constituents, of which compounds9,10,12and14are reported for the first time. Benzoic acid derivatives showed strong antifungal activity againstM. roreri, of which11(3.0 ± 0.8 µM) was the most active compound with an IC50lower compared with positive control Mancozeb®(4.9 ± 0.4 µM). Dihydrochalcones and acid derivatives were active againstF. solaniandPhytophthorasp., of which3(32.5 ± 3.3 µM) and4(26.7 ± 5.3 µM) were the most active compounds, respectively. The preliminary structure-activity relationship allowed us to establish that prenylated chains and the carboxyl group are important in the antifungal activity of benzoic acid derivatives. Likewise, a positive influence of the carbonyl group on the antifungal activity for dihydrochalcones was deduced.",
