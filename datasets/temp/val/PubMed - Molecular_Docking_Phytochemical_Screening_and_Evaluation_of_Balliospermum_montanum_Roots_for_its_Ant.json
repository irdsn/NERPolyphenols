  "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia, marked by elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, is linked to degenerative diseases often worsened by free radicals. Balliospermum montanum roots, rich in flavonoids and phenolic compounds, exhibit antioxidant properties, but their antihyperlipidemic potential remains underexplored. This study aimed to extract, fractionate, and analyze the phytochemical composition of B. montanum roots, evaluating their docking, antioxidant, and antihyperlipidemic activities. Extraction was performed using 96% methanol, followed by liquid-liquid fractionation with n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and methanol. Phytochemical screening and antioxidant assays were conducted on the methanol extract, with in-silico docking assessing binding interactions of key compounds with target enzymes. Docking revealed Baliospermin and montanin had the highest binding affinity for HMG-CoA reductase and lipase, respectively. Methanol extraction yielded 13.87%, with the methanol fraction producing the highest dried extract (39.37%). Phytochemical analysis identified flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and other bioactive constituents. The ethyl acetate fraction showed the lowest IC50values, indicating the strongest antioxidant activity, and exhibited the highest antihyperlipidemic potential. This study highlights the phytochemical composition of B. montanum roots and underscores the significant docking, antioxidant, and antihyperlipidemic properties of its fractions, supporting its potential therapeutic use.",
