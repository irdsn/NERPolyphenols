  "abstract": "The Nipah virus (NiV) poses a pressing global threat to public health due to its high mortality rate, multiple modes of transmission, and lack of effective treatments. NiV glycoprotein G (NiV-G) emerges as a promising target for the discovery of NiV drugs because of its essential role in viral entry and membrane fusion. Therefore, in this study, we applied an integrated computational and biophysics approach to identify potential inhibitors of NiV-G within a curated dataset of Peruvian phytochemicals. The virtual screening results indicated that these compounds could represent a natural source of potential NiV-G inhibitors with Î”G values ranging from -8 to -11 kcal/mol. Among them, procyanidin B2, B3, B7, and C1 exhibited the highest binding affinities and formed the most molecular interactions with NiV-G. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the induced-fit mechanism of NiV-G pocket interaction with these procyanidins, primarily driven by its hydrophobic nature. Non-equilibrium free energy calculations were used to determine binding affinities, highlighting Procyanidin B3 and B2 as the ligands with the most substantial interactions. In general, this work underscores the potential of Peruvian phytochemicals, particularly procyanidins B2, B3, B7, and C1, as lead compounds for developing anti-NiV drugs through an integrated computational biophysics approach.",
