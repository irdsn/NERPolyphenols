  "title": "Fortification of Bread with Carob Extract: A Comprehensive Study on Dough Behavior and Product Quality.",
  "abstract": "The integration of functional ingredients into staple foods like bread offers a promising strategy for improving public health. Carob (Ceratonia siliquaL.) flour, rich in bioactive compounds, has potential as a functional additive. However, its incorporation into bread negatively affects dough behavior and product quality due to high levels of insoluble dietary fibers. This study investigates the use of carob extract (PCE) as a functional additive to enhance the nutritional and bioactive profile of bread while preserving its rheological behavior and sensory quality. PCE was obtained via microwave-assisted extraction and spray drying, and incorporated into bread formulations at 1%, 3%, and 5%. The addition of PCE reduced water absorption by 1.5% and increased dough stability three times. Dough resistance increased by 15%, while extensibility decreased by 5%. The viscoelastic properties of dough were preserved, as the storage modulus increased and Tan Î´ values remained stable. Changes in specific volume, crumb texture, crumb porosity, and bread color of produced bread with PCE were minimal; however, aroma, taste, and overall sensory quality were improved. Additionally, the incorporation of PCE resulted in a significant increase in total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, indicating an enhancement of the bread's functional properties. These improvements were achieved without negatively affecting the dough rheology or bread quality parameters. Overall, the findings suggest that PCE can be a promising functional ingredient in bread formulations, contributing to both nutritional value and technological performance.",
