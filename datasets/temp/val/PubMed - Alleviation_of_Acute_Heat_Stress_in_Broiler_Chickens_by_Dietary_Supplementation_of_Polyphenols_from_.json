  "abstract": "Reducing the detrimental effects of heat stress (HS) in poultry is essential to minimize production losses. The present study evaluates the effects of dietary polyphenols prepared from underutilized wood byproducts on the growth, gut health, and cecal microbiota in broilers subjected to acute heat stress (AHS). One hundred eight one-day-old Indian River broilers were fed with 0%, 0.5%, or 1% polyphenols from shredded, steam-exploded pine particles (PSPP) in their diet. On the 37th day, forty birds were equally distributed among four groups containing either a control diet at thermoneutral temperatures (NT0%) or AHS temperatures with 0% (AHS0%), 0.5% (AHS0.5%), and 1% (AHS1%) PSPP-supplemented diets. The temperature in the NT room was maintained at 21.0 °C, while, in the AHS room, it was increased to 31 °C. AHS negatively influenced performance parameters and increased rectal temperature (RT) in broilers. The AHS0% group showed a higher expression of NOX4, HSP-70, and HSP-90 genes, while the expression was lower in PSPP-supplemented birds. In the jejunum, mRNA expression ofSODwas increased in all the birds under AHS compared to NT. The expression of theCLDN1andZO2genes was increased in AHS0%, while that of theZO1andMUC2genes was increased in PSPP-supplemented birds. HS tends to increaseTLR2andTLR4gene expression in chickens. The significantly modified genera wereBariatricus,Sporobacter,Sporanaerobacter, andNatranaerovirga. Concludingly, AHS negatively influences the performance parameters, RT, stress, gut-health-related genes, and pathogenic penetration, but PSPP supplementation reduces its bad impact by overcoming the stress and gut-health-related genes, increasing favorable bacterial abundance and reducing pathogenic penetration in chickens.",
