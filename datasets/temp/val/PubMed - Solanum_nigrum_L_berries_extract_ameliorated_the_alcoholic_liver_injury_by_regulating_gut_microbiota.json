  "abstract": "Solanum nigrum L. (SN) berry is an edible berry containing abundant polyphenols and bioactive compounds, which possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. However, the effects of SN on alcohol-induced biochemical changes in the enterohepatic axis remain unclear. In the current study, a chronic ethanol-fed mice ALD model was used to test the protective mechanisms of SN berries. Microbiota composition was determined via 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that SN berries extract (SNE) improved intestinal imbalance by reducing the Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio, restoring the abundance of Akkermansia microbiota, and reducing the abundance of Allobaculum and Shigella. SNE restored the intestinal short-chain fatty acids content. In addition, liver transcriptome data analysis revealed that SNE primarily affected the genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, SNE ameliorated hepatic steatosis in alcohol-fed mice by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α). SNE reduced the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), which can indicate that SNE mainly adjusted LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway to reduce liver inflammation. SNE enhanced hepatic antioxidant capacity by regulating NRF2-related protein expression. SNE alleviates alcoholic liver injury by regulating of gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This study may provide a reference for the development and utilization of SN resources.",
