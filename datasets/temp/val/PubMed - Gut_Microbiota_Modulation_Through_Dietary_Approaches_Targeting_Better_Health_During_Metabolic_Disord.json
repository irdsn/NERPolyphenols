  "abstract": "The impact of gut microbiota is known to play a significant role in an individual's metabolism and health. Many harmful food products or dietary imbalance adversely affect human health and changing lifestyle, environmental factors, and food habits may have their effect on gut microbiota. It has emerged that gut microbiota is regarded as an emerging metabolic organ, which is dependent on individual's diet and its composition. This review discusses the significance of lactic acid bacteria as a prominent inhabitant in the gut microbiota and the role of probiotics, prebiotics, and polyphenols to improve human health and metabolism. The role of fermented foods as an important source of probiotics and bioactive molecules is also discussed along with the role of gut microbiota in metabolic disorders like dyslipidemia, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, cancer, and hypertension. Finally, the review gives insights into the effective therapeutic prospects through gut microbiota alterations to tackle these metabolic disorders.",
