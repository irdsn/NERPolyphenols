  "abstract": "Lack of optimal sealed yellowing (SY) technique and suitable tea cultivars limits the yield and quality improvement of the Pingyang Huangtang (PYHT) tea. In this study, the effect of SY temperature, relative humidity (RH) and ventilation operation on the PYHT quality had been investigated. Results showed total sensory score was significantly influenced by SY temperature and RH, and optimal PYHT quality could be achieved when SY was performed at 60 °C, 70 % RH for 10 h with 2 ventilation operation. Quality formation of PYHT was mainly associated with degradation of chlorophylls, fluctuation of volatile with different odor notes, and decrease in level of galloylated catechins and the ratio of total polyphenols to amino acids. The quality of tea made from the shoots of 'Zhenong 801', 'Zhongcha 108', 'Jiukengzao' and '5-21' was higher than that of the commonly used cultivar 'Pingyang Tezao', therefore, these cultivars were recommended to apply in PYHT industry.",
