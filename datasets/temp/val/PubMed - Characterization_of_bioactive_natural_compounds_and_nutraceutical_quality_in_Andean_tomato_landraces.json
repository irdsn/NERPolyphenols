  "title": "Characterization of bioactive natural compounds and nutraceutical quality in Andean tomato landraces grown under optimal and elevated temperatures.",
  "abstract": "Tomatoes are rich in bioactive natural compounds (BNCs) with health benefits, though many of which remain underexplored. Wild and landrace varieties exhibit extensive genetic diversity, which is expected to yield a wide range of BNCs and enhance adaptability to climate change. This research aims to identify tomato varieties with high nutraceutical quality grown under optimal (24/18 °C) and elevated (30/24 °C) temperature conditions, comparing Andean and commercial tomatoes. Additionally, this study investigates BNCs with promising health benefits. Nutraceutical assessments included BNC analysis by HPLC-MS, in vitro antioxidant and electrophilic activities and an in vivo stress protection assay using Caenorhabditis elegans.",
