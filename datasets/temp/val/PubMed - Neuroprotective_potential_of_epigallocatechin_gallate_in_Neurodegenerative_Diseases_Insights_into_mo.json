  "title": "Neuroprotective potential of epigallocatechin gallate in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Insights into molecular mechanisms and clinical Relevance.",
  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pose significant challenges due to their complex pathophysiology and lack of effective treatments. Green tea, rich in the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) polyphenolic component, has demonstrated potential as a neuroprotective agent with numerous medicinal applications. EGCG effectively reduces tau and Aβ aggregation in ND models, promotes autophagy, and targets key signaling pathways like Nrf2-ARE, NF-κB, and MAPK. This review explores the molecular processes that underlie EGCG's neuroprotective properties, including its ability to regulate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein misfolding. Clinical research indicates that EGCG may enhance cognitive and motor abilities, potentially inhibiting disease progression despite absorption and dose optimization limitations. The substance has been proven to slow the amyloidogenic process, prevent protein aggregation, decrease amyloid cytotoxicity, inhibit fibrillogenesis, and restructure fibrils for synergistic therapeutic effects. The review highlights the potential of EGCG as a natural, multi-targeted strategy for NDs but emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.",
