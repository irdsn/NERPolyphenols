  "abstract": "(1) Background: Tannic acid (TA), a water-soluble polyphenol extensively found in numerous plant species, possesses antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and adhesive properties. This scoping review aims to synthesize existing knowledge on TA applications and unveil its potential uses in dentistry. (2) Methods: A comprehensive search across six electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Opengrey) was conducted in October 2024. Two reviewers performed the screening and risk of bias analysis independently following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The findings are presented in a narrative summary. (3) Results: Five hundred and twelve records were identified from the electronic databases. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, ninety-six studies were ultimately included in this review. Results indicate that TA has been employed in managing dentin hypersensitivity, dental caries, periodontal and mucosal diseases, as well as dentition defects with prostheses. Furthermore, TA displays potential in enhancing the performance of bonding adhesives, root canal irrigants, and root canal filling materials. However, it is noteworthy that the included studies exhibit varied experimental settings, inconsistent outcome measures, a lack of extensive clinical research, and insufficient observation periods. (4) Conclusions: TA is a promising biomaterial with applications to various dental fields, such as endodontics, periodontology, prosthodontics, and dental public health. Its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and adhesive properties warrant future exploration to unleash these potentials and provide robust scientific evidence that guides clinical practice and advances oral healthcare.",
