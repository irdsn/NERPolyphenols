  "abstract": "Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins) were isolated from the pulp of Chinese hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida Bge. var. major N.E.Br.) and fractioned into three subfractions (F1-F3) using 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % ethanol on a macroporous resin column. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis revealed that epicatechin-polymerized procyanidins were the predominant components of the three subfractions, with mean degrees of polymerization (mDP) of 5.78, 10.09, and 3.03, respectively. These subfractions exhibited excellent antioxidant capacity and showed a significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) with mDP. The subfraction F2was further proven to be an efficient inhibitor of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and bacteria. In addition, subfraction F2controlled the browning of fresh-cut apples by regulating phenolic metabolism, enhancing antioxidant system, and reducing lipid peroxidation. Overall, these findings provided a theoretical foundation for utilizing condensed tannins from Chinese hawthorn pulp as an effective anti-browning agent for fruits and vegetables.",
