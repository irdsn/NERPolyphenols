  "abstract": "Invasive bacteria have caused tremendous losses to global ecosystems and agricultural production, yet effective control measures remain elusive. Plant specialized metabolites are being investigated as an important source of antimicrobial active substances. AndAilanthus altissimais an abundant tree widespread throughout Northeast China. In this study, we identified 21 compounds fromA. altissimaleaves, including steroids, terpenes, phenolics, and coumarins. Two new steroidal compounds, ailanstigol A (1) and ailanstigol B (2), and one new coumarin (2'R,3'R)-7-(2',3',6'-trihydroxy-3'-methylhexyloxy)-6,8-dimethoxycoumarin (3) were isolated. Antibacterial screening revealed that compounds1and2exhibited inhibitory activity against two invasive bacteria,Xanthomonas oryzaepv.oryzaePXO 71A and PXO 86A andPseudomonas syringaepv.maculicolaES4326. Further mechanistic screening unveiled that the steroidal compounds1and2may inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction by reducing cell viability, disrupting the cell membrane and increasing protein leakage, and inhibiting biofilm formation. In summary, our results enriched the known chemical diversity ofA. altissimaand provided a foundation for investigating the mechanisms by which steroidal compounds inhibit invasive bacterial growth.",
