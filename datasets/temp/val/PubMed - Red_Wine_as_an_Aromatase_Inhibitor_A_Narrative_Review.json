  "title": "Red Wine as an Aromatase Inhibitor: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "As estrogen-dependent breast cancer is more affected by the local production of estrogen via aromatase than serum estrogen, aromatase inhibitors for treating breast carcinomas in postmenopausal women have been developed. As the aromatase enzyme converts endogenous androgen to estrogenic compounds, its blockade lowers the in situ production of estrogen, demonstrated to encourage tumor proliferation. Red wine, but not white wine, may have aromatase-inhibiting properties that are being elucidated, although the exact mechanisms of action are not known. Polyphenols, tannins, and resveratrol have all been implicated as aromatase blockers, and there may also be synergistic interplay among selected constituents. The role of red wine would be in chemoprevention, the use of natural or synthetic substances to retard, block, or reverse cancer. One gene encodes aromatase, so aromatase inhibition would stop endogenous estrogen production. The role of aromatase inhibition in breast cancer in premenopausal women is not clear. While animal studies have demonstrated that red wine contains constituents that could block aromatase in vivo, the benefits also exist with nonalcoholic grape seed extract. Further investigation is needed but there are challenges in designing appropriate clinical trials for a substance as variable as red wine. While there is insufficient evidence to advocate for red wine as an aromatase inhibitor, there is sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.",
