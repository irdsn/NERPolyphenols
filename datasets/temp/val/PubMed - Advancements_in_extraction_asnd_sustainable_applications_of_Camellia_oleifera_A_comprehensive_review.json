  "title": "Advancements in extraction asnd sustainable applications of Camellia oleifera: A comprehensive review.",
  "abstract": "Camellia oleifera, a native Chinese oilseed with a 2300-year history, is valued for its oil (CO) and by-products like seed husk and oil cake. CO is rich in bioactive compounds, including fatty acids, polyphenols, tocopherols, phytosterols, squalene, and saponins, offering health benefits such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, as well as cholesterol, blood sugar, and lipid regulation. This review explores the impact of variety and geographical location on these compounds, providing a comparative analysis. We also examine the latest advancements in CO extraction, and pre-treatment methods in optimizing extraction outcomes that enhance efficiency and bioactive content. Additionally, we discuss the role of the analytical techniques used to characterize these bioactive compounds. Beyond health applications, we highlight the use of CO and its by-products in functional foods, skincare, biopreservation, and sustainable agriculture. This review aims to guide future research and development, promoting the sustainable utilization of CO and its by-products.",
