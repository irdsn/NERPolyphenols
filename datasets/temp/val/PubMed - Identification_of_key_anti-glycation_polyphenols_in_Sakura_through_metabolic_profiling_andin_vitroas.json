  "abstract": "Sakura, a traditional edible flower, has been investigated for its anti-glycation potential; however, the bioactive components remain unclear. Polyphenols are recognized for their exceptional anti-glycation properties. In this study, main polyphenols were identified from seven varieties through metabolomics. 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-OCA), 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3-OCA), and caffeic acid were confirmed as key agents through multivariate analysis, which was further validated by anti-glycation assessments. The concentrations of these polyphenols inCerasus serrulata 'Kanzan'(CK) were 2.52 ± 0.08, 3.31 ± 0.18 and 2.38 ± 0.15 mg/g, respectively, contributing to its superior AGEs inhibition ratio (100 μg/mL) of 76.11 ± 0.40 %. Simulated digestion revealed that isomerization between 5-OCA and 3-OCA occurred during the gastric phase. Both compounds were metabolized to caffeic acid in the intestinal phase, contributing to a sustained anti-glycation activity of 64.74 ± 1.11 %. Overall, our study provides a theoretical basis for the development of Sakura-based functional foods targeting anti-glycation.",
