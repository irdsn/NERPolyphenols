  "abstract": "Polyphenols represent a broad class of natural chemical compounds comprising, but not limited to, tannins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, flavanones, flavanols, anthocyanins, and their related polymerized derivatives. Polyphenols are an important component of various commercial, naturally derived products with therapeutic properties. However, their full therapeutic potential is restricted by inherently low solubility and limited dispersibility in the aqueous phase.",
