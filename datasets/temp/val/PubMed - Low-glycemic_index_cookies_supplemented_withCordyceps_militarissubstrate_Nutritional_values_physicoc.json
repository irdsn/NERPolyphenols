  "abstract": "Cordyceps militarissubstrate (CMS) is a novel ingredient rich in dietary fibers and bioactive compounds; however, its application in food products remains largely unexplored. This study introduces CMS as a partial wheat flour substitute for developing low-glycemic cookies enriched with dietary fiber and bioactive compounds. Results indicate that CMS supplementation increased fiber and phenolic content by 1.41-2.95 times and 1.30-2.62 times, respectively, compared to unsupplemented cookies. Additionally, carotenoid levels were 15.50-71.34 times higher than those in wheat-based cookies. The simulated digestion system revealed that CMS-supplemented cookies exhibited a low glycemic index (47.9-54.0) while enhancing higher polyphenol and carotenoid release than the controls. Cookies with 15Â % CMS supplementation qualified as a \"source of fiber\", high-carotenoid, and low-GI food classification while maintaining acceptable sensory attributes. These findings underscore the potential of CMS in food innovation, offering a promising approach to enhancing nutrient intake across populations.",
