  "title": "Effects of delayed tuber cutting after catalytic infrared heat treatment on browning of fresh-cut potatoes and its potential mechanisms.",
  "abstract": "Heat treatment, a form of thermal stress can confer anti-browning properties to potato tubers. However, the effect of delayed cutting after catalytic infrared heat treatment (DC-CIRHT) on browning inhibition remains unexplored. The study optimized catalytic infrared heat treatment conditions (55 °C for 10 min) and delayed cutting time (3 d). DC-CIRHT significantly inhibited the increase of browning index and browning degree and did not affect the quality of potato tubers. The mechanisms underlying browning inhibition involve two aspects: the reduction of phenolic-enzyme catalysis and the enhancement of the defense system. DC-CIRHT inhibits browning by suppressing polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme activity, reducing total phenol and flavonoid content, enhancing antioxidant activity, reducing membrane permeability and MDA, and balancing amino acid metabolism. This method offers a novel strategy for inhibiting browning during the post-harvest storage and processing of fruits and vegetables.",
