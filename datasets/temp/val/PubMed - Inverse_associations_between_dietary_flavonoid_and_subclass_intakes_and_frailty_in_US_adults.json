  "abstract": "Dietary flavonoids, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may play a role in frailty prevention, but comprehensive population-based studies are lacking. This study aimed to examine the associations between dietary flavonoid intakes and the prevalence of frailty in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, and to identify the predominant flavonoid subclasses contributing to these associations.",
