  "abstract": "Thirteen varieties of feijoa (Feijoa sellowiana) fruit were collected and the physical and chemical properties of feijoa peel, flesh, seed, and leaf were analyzed. Large diversities in the physicochemical characteristics and phenolic and volatile composition among various parts and between different varieties of feijoa were observed. Degrees Brix of whole fruits ranged from 10.1 (Anatoki) to 18.0 (No. 2) Â°Brix. Procyanidin B-type tetramer, procyanidin B-type dimer, and procyanidin C-type trimer had the highest concentrations in all parts and varieties of feijoa. Caffeoyl glucose, dihydroferulic acid 4-O-glucuronide, galloyl glucose, and lariciresinol-sesquilignan were detected in feijoa fruits and leaves. A total of 105 esters, 68 terpenes, 20 alcohols, 31 hydrocarbons, 12 aldehydes, and 11 ketones were related to aromatic attributes of fruits and leaves. Early season and mid-season varieties had larger variations in the chemical properties than late-season varieties. Anatoki, Kakariki, and No.1, have the potential to be developed for attractive flavor and functional properties.",
