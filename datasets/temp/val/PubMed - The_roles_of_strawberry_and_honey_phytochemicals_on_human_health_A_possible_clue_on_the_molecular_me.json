  "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to the etiopathogenesis of several human chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Besides classic stimuli, such as reactive oxidant species, endotoxins (i.e., bacteria lipopolysaccharide), cytokines or carcinogens, oxidative stress and inflammation can be triggered by a poor diet and an excess of body fat and energy intake. Strawberry and honey are common rich sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds, widely studied for their roles exerted in health maintenance and disease prevention.",
