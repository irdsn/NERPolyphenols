  "abstract": "A total of twenty-one compounds were obtained from the whole plant ofCuscuta chinensisLam. The compounds' structures were identified as 3-hydroxy-N-phenethylpropanamide (1), (+)-pinoresinol-O-β-D- glucopyranoside (2), simplexoside (3), (+)-pinoresinol (4), scopoletin (5), (-)-loliolide (6),N-trans-feruloyltyramine (7), (+)-syringaresinol (8), medioresinol (9), 3,4-dehydrotheaspirone (10), 2-ethoxy-1H-pyrimidine-4,6-dione (11), ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate(12), hydroquinone (13), vanillic acid (14),β-daucosterol (15), methyl 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoate (16), roseoside (17), vomifoliol (18), pyrocatechol (19),E-p-coumaric acid (20),Z-p-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (21). Among them, ten compounds (1,3,5,6,10,11,16,17,18,19) were isolated from this plant for the first time, while compound1was isolated as an undescribed natural compound. Moreover, the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts indicated potential bioactivity, and compound2showed certain anti-inflammatory activity. This study provides a scientific basis for elucidating the composites and activity ofC. chinensis.",
