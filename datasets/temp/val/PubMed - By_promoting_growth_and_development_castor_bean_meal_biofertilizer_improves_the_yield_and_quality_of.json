  "abstract": "Fertilizer selection and application is closely related to crop yield and quality. Tartary buckwheat is a medicinal and food crops, has a broad space for development. However, the effect of castor bean meal biofertilizer on the growth and development, yield and quality of Tartary buckwheat and Tartary buckwheat buds is not clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of castor bean meal biofertilizer on Tartary buckwheat yield and quality, and then to elucidate the effect of castor bean meal biofertilizer indirectly on Tartary buckwheat bud yield and quality.",
