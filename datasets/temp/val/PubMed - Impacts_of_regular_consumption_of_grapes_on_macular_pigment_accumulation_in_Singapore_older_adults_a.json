  "abstract": "Background: Oxidative stress is a key risk factor for visual impairment and consuming dietary antioxidant-rich foods may help in managing visual impairments. However, a limited number of studies have investigated the effect of dietary antioxidant-rich food including grapes on eye health in older adults.Objectives: To assess the effects on macular pigment accumulation of regular consumption of grapes in Singapore older adults.Methods: This was a 16 week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty-four Singapore older adults were randomized into regularly consuming either 46 g day-1of freeze-dried table grape powder (the intervention group) or the same amount of placebo powder (the control group). Macular pigment optical density (MPOD), skin carotenoid status, advanced glycation end product (AGEs) status and dietary lutein intake were assessed every 4 weeks, and plasma lutein concentration, total antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were measured every 8 weeks.Results: A significant time effect (p= 0.007) was observed for MPOD, and this is largely attributed to the improvement in the MPOD for the intervention group, as a significant increase was observed only in this group (week 0: 0.56 ± 0.04 D.U.; week 16: 0.61 ± 0.04 D.U.,p< 0.01). Additionally, a significant increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity (week 0: 0.26 ± 0.13 mM TEAC; week 16: 0.36 ± 0.20 mM TEAC,p< 0.01) and total phenolic content (week 0: 10.50 ± 0.44 mg L-1GAE; week 16: 12.58 ± 0.55 mg L-1GAE,p< 0.001) was observed for the intervention group only. In contrast, a significant increase in skin AGE status was observed in the control group (week 0: 2.47 ± 0.24; week 16: 2.99 ± 0.12,p< 0.05) while this was mitigated in the intervention group. There were no differences in dietary lutein intake, plasma lutein concentration and skin carotenoid status between groups throughout the study.Conclusions: Regular intake of grapes may improve eye health in Singapore older adults, specifically in augmenting MPOD, which can be explained by an increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity and phenolic content, and the downregulation of AGEs. This study was registered at clinicatrials.gov as NCT05064865.",
