  "abstract": "Anthocyanins (ACNs) are water-soluble natural pigments exhibiting multiple physiologically active properties. However, their limited stability and bioavailability restrict their use in functional foods and pharmaceutical field applications. In this study, a FU-MEV-ACNs nano-delivery system was successfully constructed by encapsulating ACNs within milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MEV) via ultrasonication, followed by surface coating with fucoidan (FU). As anticipated, FU-MEV-ACNs exhibited a small particle size (approximately 190.8 nm) and uniform distribution (PDI: 0.167 ± 0.017). Under simulated beverage processing, storage, and digestive conditions, FU-MEV-ACNs effectively delayed ACNs degradation. Furthermore, they enhanced ACNs permeation through an artificial intestinal mucus layer. Compared to free ACNs, FU-MEV-ACNs significantly elevated intracellular antioxidant levels and suppressed inflammatory cytokine expression in acrylamide-induced RAW264.7 cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that FU-MEV-ACNs were internalized and markedly reduced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. Oral administration of FU-MEV-ACNs notably alleviated colonic morphological abnormalities and inflammatory infiltration in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice. Thus, the FU-MEV-ACNs system enhances ACNs stability and bolsters their capacity to mitigate oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This study provides a novel carrier platform with targeted delivery potential for ACNs-based functional foods, while demonstrating significant translational value in nutritional interventions for inflammatory bowel disease.",
