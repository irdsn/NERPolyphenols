  "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of proteins with enzymatic activity. In particular, they are a family of class III NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases. NAD+-dependent deac(et)ylase activities catalyzed by sirtuin include ac(et)ylation, propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, manylation, and succinylation. Specifically, human SIRT3 is a 399 amino acid protein with two functional domains: a large Rossmann folding motif and NAD+binding, and a small complex helix and zinc-binding motif. SIRT3 is widely expressed in mitochondria-rich tissues and is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, homeostasis, and function. Moreover, SIRT3 regulates related diseases, such as aging, hepatic, kidney, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, and cancer development. In particular, one of the most significant and damaging post-translational modifications is irreversible protein oxidation, i.e. carbonylation. This process is induced explicitly by increased ROS production due to mitochondrial dysfunction. SIRT3 is carbonylated by 4-hydroxynonenal at the level of Cys280. The carbonylation induces conformational changes in the active site, resulting in allosteric inhibition of SIRT3 activity and loss of the ability to deacetylate and regulate antioxidant enzyme activity. Phytochemicals and, in particular, polyphenols, thanks to their strong antioxidant activity, are natural compounds with a positive regulatory action on SIRT3 in various pathologies. Indeed, the enzymatic SIRT3 activity is modulated, for example, by different natural polyphenol classes, including resveratrol and the bergamot polyphenolic fraction. Thus, this review aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which phytochemicals can interact with SIRT3, resulting in post-translational modifications that regulate cellular metabolism.",
