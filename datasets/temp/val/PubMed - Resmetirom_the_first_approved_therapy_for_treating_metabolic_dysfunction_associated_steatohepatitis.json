  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), previously referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has emerged as one of the leading indications for liver transplantation in the United States. The disease is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with early-stage liver fibrosis and a heightened risk of hepatic complications in those with advanced fibrosis. Despite its growing prevalence and significant healthcare burden, there were no approved drugs to treat this chronic disease. In March 2024, Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist, became the first drug to receive FDA approval for the treatment of patients with MASH and fibrosis stages F2/F3. This accelerated approval was granted based on significantly higher rates of MASH resolution and fibrosis.",
