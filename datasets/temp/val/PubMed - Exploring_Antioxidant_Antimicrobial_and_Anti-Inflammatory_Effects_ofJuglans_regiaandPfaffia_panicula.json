  "abstract": "Background/Objectives:Colorectal neoplasms rank as the third most prevalent cancer globally and stand as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Its etiology is multifaceted, pointing to the role of microorganisms within the human microbiota in its development. Notably, the high prevalence of oral pathogens likeFusobacterium nucleatumandParvimonas micrais implicated in inducing gut dysbiosis and stimulating the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate in vitro the biological effects of extracts fromJuglans regiaandPfaffia paniculata.Methods:Phytochemical analysis was carried out by HPLC, and the antioxidant effect was determined by DPPH. Antimicrobial activity was investigated onF. nucleatumandP. micraplanktonic and biofilms. Metabolic activity and genotoxicity were performed.Results:J. regiaandP. paniculataexpressed CE50 37.26 and 1367.57 mcg, respectively. The extracts exhibited a minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.73 and 0.48 mg/mL forJ. regiaandP. paniculata, respectively. Reduction superiorly 90% ofP. micrabiofilms. Metabolic activity was varied proportionally to the extract concentration, and no genotoxic effects were observed.Conclusions:TheJ. regiaextract has great antioxidant activity and could be used as an alternative in combating pathogens associated with the onset of dysbiosis and tumor progression in colorectal neoplasms. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to validate their clinical applicability.",
