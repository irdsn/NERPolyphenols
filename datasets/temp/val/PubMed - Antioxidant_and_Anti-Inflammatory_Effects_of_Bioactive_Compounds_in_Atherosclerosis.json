  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and immune cells within arterial walls, remains a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress and inflammation are central to its pathogenesis, driving endothelial dysfunction, foam cell formation, and plaque instability. Emerging evidence highlights the potential of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these processes and promote vascular health. This review explores the mechanisms through which bioactive compounds-such as polyphenols, carotenoids, flavonoids, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and other natural compounds-modulate oxidative stress and inflammation in atherosclerosis. It examines their effects on key molecular pathways, including the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suppression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and modulation of inflammatory cytokines. By integrating current knowledge, this review underscores the therapeutic potential of dietary and supplemental bioactive compounds as complementary strategies for managing atherosclerosis, paving the way for future research and clinical applications.",
