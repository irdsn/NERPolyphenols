  "abstract": "Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea(L.) Verdc.) is an underutilized leguminous crop, with its grains consumed differently, especially in developing countries. Bambara groundnut (BGN) is the cheapest source of protein and a rich source of dietary fiber, carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals. It also contains a variety of non-nutritional components known as phytochemicals. The phytochemicals in BGN include polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, phytic acid, oxalate, and trypsin inhibitors. Nevertheless, some phytochemicals are classified as antinutrients because they impair nutrient absorption. Bambara groundnut also contains metabolites, such as epicatechin, catechin, procyanidin, esters, and citric acid. Bioprocessing, such as dehulling, germination, malting, fermentation, ultrasonication, micronization, and others, reduces BGN flour's antinutrients. However, bioprocessing may increase or decrease the levels of metabolites in BGN flour. For example, fermentation increases esters, whereas malting decreases them. Various studies have reported the use of BGN flour in bakery products, meat products, non-alcoholic beverages, pasta, and others. Thus, this study aimed to review the influence of bioprocessing on the nutritional quality, antinutrients, functional characteristics, and metabolites of BGN flour and its potential food applications. This study will explore the health benefits of bioprocessed BGN flour and promote its use in various food products.",
