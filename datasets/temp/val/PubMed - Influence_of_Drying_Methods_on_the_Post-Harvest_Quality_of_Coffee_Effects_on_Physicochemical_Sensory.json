  "abstract": "This study evaluated the impact of different drying methods on the physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory qualities of coffees produced in the Campos das Vertentes (CV) and Alta Mogiana (AM) regions of Brazil. The sun-drying (S), sun-drying combined with rotary mechanical dryer (SM), and CoffeeDryer®mechanical dryer (C) methods were compared at different harvest times for the same crop (2024). The results indicated that CoffeeDryer®preserved relatively high levels of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, reaching 3.24 g of gallic acid equivalents per 100 g (g EAG·100 g-1) and 47.96% antioxidant protection in the coffees produced in Alta Mogiana, whereas the sun-dried coffees presented relatively low values (2.20 g EAG·100 g-1and 28.96% protection). In the Campos das Vertentes region, C maintained 2.78 g EAG·100 g-1phenolic compounds and 50.29% antioxidant protection, outperforming combined drying (2.48 g EAG·100 g-1and 41.17%). Regardless of the region and time of harvest, the coffees dried by C had a water activity of less than 0.6 and more stable moisture content (7.73-10.42%), reducing the possibility of proliferation of filamentous fungi and, consequently, mycotoxins. In the sensory evaluation, CoffeeDryer®guaranteed higher scores for fragrance/aroma and flavor, allowing the coffees to reach 80 to 81 points on the SCA scale, which is classified as special. Thus, the use of CoffeeDryer®proved to be an efficient alternative for optimizing coffee drying, preserving its chemical and microbiological qualities, and enhancing its commercial and sensory value.",
