  "abstract": "Jackfruit peels, often discarded as waste, represent a valuable source of polyphenols that enhance the resistance of soybean and sunflower oils to oxidation at frying temperatures. The JPE exhibited total polyphenolic content (16.32 mg GAE/g), flavonoid content (0.66 mg QuE/g), antioxidant capacity (0.20 mg/mL), and DPPH scavenging activity (5.65 μg/mL). FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of polyphenols, primary and secondary alcohols, and other functional groups, while HRAMS analysis identified 64 bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties. JPE demonstrated excellent antioxidant activity, particularly under refrigerated (5 °C) and dark conditions. Oils subjected to frying temperatures (150-180 °C) were analyzed for oxidation parameters, composition of fatty acids, and color. The incorporation of JPE significantly (p < 0.05) reduced acid value, peroxide value, TOTOX value, p-anisidine value, total polar compounds, fatty acid degradation, and color changes compared to control samples. Sensory evaluation revealed that polyphenol-enriched sunflower and soybean oils had higher overall acceptability than fresh oil samples.",
