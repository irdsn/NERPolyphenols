  "abstract": "Sunburn stress is one of the main environmental stress factors that seriously affects the fruit development and quality of Chinese olive, a tropical and subtropical fruit in south China. Therefore, the understanding of the changes in physiological, biochemical, metabolic, and gene expression in response to sunburn stress is of great significance for the industry and breeding of Chinese olive. In this study, the different stress degrees of Chinese olive fruits, including serious sunburn injury (SSI), mild sunburn injury (MSI), and ordinary (control check, CK) samples, were used to identify the physiological and biochemical changes and explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) by using transcriptomics and metabolomics. Compared with CK, the phenotypes, antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant-related enzyme activities of sunburn stress samples changed significantly. Based on DEG-based KEGG metabolic pathway analysis of transcriptomics, the polyphenol and flavonoid-related pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, sesquiterpenoid, and triterpenoid biosynthesis, monoterpene biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, isoflavonoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, were enriched under sunburn stress of Chinese olive. Meanwhile, 33 differentially accumulated polyphenols and 99 differentially accumulated flavonoids were identified using metabolomics. According to the integration of transcriptome and metabolome, 15 and 8 DEGs were predicted to regulate polyphenol and flavonoid biosynthesis in Chinese olive, including 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), cinnamoyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS). Additionally, the content of total polyphenols and flavonoids was found to be significantly increased in MSI and SSI samples compared with CK. Our research suggested that the sunburn stress probably activates the transcription of the structural genes involved in polyphenol and flavonoid biosynthesis in Chinese olive fruits to affect the antioxidant capacity and increase the accumulation of polyphenols and flavonoids, thereby responding to this abiotic stress.",
