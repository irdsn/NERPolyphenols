  "title": "The road for red raspberry seeds valorization: A comprehensive review on the chemical composition, extraction techniques, bioactivity and applications.",
  "abstract": "Raspberry seeds (RS) are rich in polysaccharides, triacylglycerides, and polyphenols, but detailed composition information remains largely scarce and centered on its specialty oil (RSO). Furthermore, defatted RS has no application and is discarded, creating environmental and economic burdens. This comprehensive review aims to compile and critically discuss existing data on RS chemical composition, extraction techniques, bioactive properties, and current applications. RS variety and harvest conditions and lack of proper analysis and quantification methodologies impact RS deep knowledge. Green extraction techniques revealed good efficiency while supporting a sustainable approach compared to conventional ones, but their industrial scale-up is underdeveloped. RS revealed several bioactivities, mainly explored in vitro, but the structure-function relationship is often missing. Current commercial exploitation of RS biocomponents is limited to cosmetics despite RS exploration for food fortification by nutritional enrichment and oil stabilization. The findings underscore the importance of further research to fully realize the potential of RS.",
