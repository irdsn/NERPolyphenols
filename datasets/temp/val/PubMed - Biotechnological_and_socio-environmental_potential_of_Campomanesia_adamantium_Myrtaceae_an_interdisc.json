  "abstract": "Guavira (Campomanesia adamantium, Myrtaceae) is a native fruit from the Brazilian Cerrado savanna and is socio-economically important for the indigenous and traditional people living in the Central-West. This is a bibliographic review of the biological properties of guavira and its derivatives, and, after discussing experimental studies, an interdisciplinary approach is conducted highlighting the im-portance of Agroforestry Systems as an ecological restoration tool to leverage the production chain of guavira while providing ecosystem services. Many research groups studied effects of polyphenols and other bioactive compounds and biological properties of this fruit and other plant parts such as antibiotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-diarrheic and antitumoral activities, cardiovascular and hepatic protection and action against neuropathic pain. Besides, guavira by-products benefit poultry intestinal health, similarly to antibiotics added to their feed. Furthermore, several biotechnological products were found, like pulp flour, seasoning from the peel, sunscreen, and seed oil similar to olive oil with pharmaceutical and industrial potential. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of guavira for restoration and preservation of the threatened Brazilian Cerrado, and for the socio-environmental development of family agriculture. The same approach and study are welcome and necessary in other regions and domains worldwide having their native flora as means for a restorative end.",
