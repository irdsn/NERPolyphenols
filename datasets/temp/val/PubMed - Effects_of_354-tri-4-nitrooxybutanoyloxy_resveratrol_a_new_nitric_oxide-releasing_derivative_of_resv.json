  "abstract": "Resveratrol is a polyphenol of red wine that is thought to contribute to the \"French paradox\" by protecting against atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and enhances nitric oxide (NO) production. However, in conditions of severe endothelial dysfunction, its cardiovascular protective effects may be limited. Our study aimed to synthesize and characterize a new nitro derivative of resveratrol, trinitroresveratrol (TN-RSV), for its potential nitric oxide-donating and antiplatelet effects.",
