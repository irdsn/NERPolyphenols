  "abstract": "Besides the need to adapt coffee cultivation to climate change, the growing demand for high-quality and exotic coffee has increased interest in species such as Coffea racemosa and C. zanguebariae. These species offer drought and pest resistance, fast maturation, and distinct sensory profiles. However, there is a lack of information regarding their chemical profile. Therefore, this study employed a metabolomic approach using LC-MS, ESI(±)MS, and multivariate analysis to assess the chemical profiles of these species and compare them with C. arabica and C. canephora cv. Conilon. Sixty-four compounds were identified, including chlorogenic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and glycosylated diterpenes. The results indicate that C. racemosa shares chemical similarities with C. arabica, particularly in their trigonelline and amino acid abundance, while C. zanguebariae is characterized by a high phospholipid content, which may influence mouthfeel. Additionally, LC-MS allows isomer separation, whereas ESI(±)MS emerged as a fast alternative for chemometric modeling.",
