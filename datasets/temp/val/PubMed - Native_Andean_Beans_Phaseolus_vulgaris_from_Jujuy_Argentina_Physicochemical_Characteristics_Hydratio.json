  "abstract": "Andean beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) from Jujuy, Argentina are in danger of extinction due to limited consumption and a lack of knowledge about their potential. The objective was to characterize 15 Andean bean genotypes recovered from small populations in remote Andean regions. Among these, 10 are ñuñas and 5 are beans. Ñuña is a type of spherical bean considered the ancestor of modern commercial beans, while beans are elongated, kidney-shaped, and larger. Morphological, nutritional, and antioxidant characteristics were evaluated, and hydration and roasting properties were quantified. Protein content ranged from 16 to 25%. While some genotypes exhibited significant antioxidant activity, no correlation was found between anthocyanin content, total polyphenols, and seed coat color, unlike reports from other authors. Swelling capacity reached values up to 140%. The popping yield of the ñuñas reached a maximum value of 36%. Principal component analysis grouped the genotypes into two clusters according to possible use: one associated with higher expansion capacity and anthocyanin levels, and the other with moderate to high protein content, of which some stand out for their hydration properties. The first group shows potential for roasted snacks, while the second group is better suited for traditional boiled dishes or high-protein formulations. The relevance of this work lies in providing original information on the properties of these native Andean crops that allows promoting their food use and conservation.",
