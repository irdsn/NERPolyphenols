  "abstract": "Cantharidin, an active compound with well-established clinical efficacy, is a defensive secondary metabolite primarily derived from insects in the Meloidae family. The study of cantharidin's synthetic pathway is not only one of the most intriguing research areas within the Meloidae family, but also holds promise in bridging the gap between biological defense mechanisms and clinical applicability. This paper provides a concise overview of the cantharidin-related biological characteristics of Meloidae beetles. It then summarizes recent advances in research on the synthetic pathway of cantharidin, focusing on three key areas: the synthesis of sesquiterpene precursors, the production and metabolism of farnesol, and its connection to juvenile hormone metabolism. The hypothesis is proposed that the biosynthetic pathway starts with the mevalonate pathway, which synthesizes farnesol, the identified precursor of cantharidin. Farnesol is subsequently converted by enzymes into farnesoic acid, which is further transformed into juvenile hormone acid. Juvenile hormone acid is then converted into juvenile hormone acid diol, which participates in the synthesis of cantharidin. Finally, we propose a speculative synthesis pathway for cantharidin based on current research findings and discuss its implications.",
