  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder linked to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. This study evaluates the neurofunctional and immunomodulatory effects of an aqueous extract combining cocoa seed husk and guarana powder (GuaCa). Eighteen extracts were characterized by flavonoid and polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, and genoprotective potential. The HCE3 extract, rich in catechins, quercetin, and epigallocatechin gallate, was selected for further analysis in three models:Eisenia fetidaearthworms, SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PD patients.",
