  "abstract": "Pre-harvest application of elicitors improves grape quality, specifically the phenolic compounds and color characteristics. Limited research has been conducted on the impact of elicitors on the C6 compounds found in grapes. This is due to lack of comprehensive studies examining the combined effects of bound aroma compounds, enzyme activity, and substrate availability. This study aimed to assess the impact of benzothiadiazole (BTH) on the physicochemical properties and C6 compounds of Cabernet Gernischt grapes during ripening. Compared with the control group (CK), BTH treatment significantly increased the 100-berry weight, skin/berry ratio, pH, total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content in ripe grapes. Additionally, BTH treatment led to significant reductions in reducing sugar, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and free C6 aldehydes. Furthermore, BTH treatment significantly decreased the contents of free C6 alcohols and increased the levels of free and bound C6 esters. BTH treatment also increased the activities of lipoxygenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alcohol acetyltransferase enzymes, while it decreased the activity of hydroperoxide lyase enzyme. The application of BTH resulted in changes to the physicochemical properties and levels of C6 compounds in Cabernet Gernischt grapes by up-regulating enzyme activity and down-regulating precursors.",
