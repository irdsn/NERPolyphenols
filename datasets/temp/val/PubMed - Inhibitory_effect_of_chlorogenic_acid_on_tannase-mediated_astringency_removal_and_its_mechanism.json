  "title": "Inhibitory effect of chlorogenic acid on tannase-mediated astringency removal and its mechanism.",
  "abstract": "Phenolic acids, such as chlorogenic acid (CGA) and rosmarinic acid (RA), are added to plant-based beverages as nutritional supplements to enhance their health benefits. However, these compounds can also interfere with the astringency-reducing effect of tannase. This study employed electronic tongue analysis, enzyme inhibition kinetics, spectroscopy, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the inhibitory mechanisms of CGA and RA on tannase-mediated deastringency.",
