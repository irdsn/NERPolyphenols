  "abstract": "The consumption of organic foods is on the rise, as health-conscious consumers increasingly perceive them as superior both in nutritional value and for overall well-being. However, data on the nutritional and sensory properties of organic chestnuts remain scarce. This research aimed to evaluate and compare the nutritional and sensory characteristics of organic and conventional chestnuts. Results indicate that organic chestnuts exhibit a distinct sensory profile and achieve significantly higher overall scores in sensory analysis compared to conventional chestnuts. Specifically, organic chestnuts displayed stronger aromas of chestnut (9 vs. 8), hazelnut (5.87 vs. 5), almond (5 vs. 4), butter (3.96 vs. 3), and floral notes (5.95 vs. 4.96). Notably, organic chestnuts were strongly characterized by a caramel aroma, which was completely absent in conventional chestnuts (1.95 vs. 0), and probably due to the exclusive presence of decanal and 1-pentanol observed among the volatile compounds. Furthermore, organic chestnuts demonstrated a higher nutritional value, particularly in terms of antioxidant content. The total phenolic content (TPC) was significantly greater in organic chestnuts (6.54 mg GAE/g) compared to conventional samples (5.18 mg GAE/g). The relationships between attributes and consumers' perceived liking revealed a strong association between liking and the attributes of caramel, floral, hazelnut, almond, and chestnut. These attributes are specific to organic chestnuts. As a result, both consumers and the trained panel prefer organic chestnut samples over conventional ones. Promoting the consumption of organic chestnuts by enhancing knowledge and awareness of their characteristics can encourage their use, contributing to key health and environmental sustainability goals.",
