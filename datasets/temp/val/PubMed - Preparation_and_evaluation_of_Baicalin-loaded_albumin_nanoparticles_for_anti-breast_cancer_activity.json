  "abstract": "Baicalin (BA), a natural flavonoid compound, exhibits potential anti-breast cancer (BC) activity. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by biological membrane and tumor barriers. Albumin nanoparticles demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and ease of modification, making them highly advantageous for antitumor drug delivery. Despite these advantages, current preparation methods for albumin-based NPs have significant limitations, including the use of organic or toxic reagents, large and uneven particle size products, complex processes, etc. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a novel method for preparing albumin nanoparticles (BSA NPs). Subsequently, BSA NPs were modified with folic acid (FA) and polymers and loaded with BA to construct a novel nanodrug delivery system (BA@mPEG-FA-BSA NPs) to improve the anti-breast cancer efficacy of BA.",
