  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by the impaired utilization of glucose, insulin resistance, or reduced insulin production. Although conventional pharmacologic agents like metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones are effective in regulating elevated blood glucose levels, they are often associated with some adverse effects, such as weight gain and liver problems. The present review summarizes the possibility of using phytochemicals as safer alternatives for the management of DM by modulation of molecular receptors.",
