  "abstract": "Presbycusis or Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a sensorineural hearing loss that affects communication, leading to depression and social isolation. Currently, there are no effective treatments against ARHL. It is known that cocoa products have high levels of polyphenol content (mainly flavonoids), that are potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents with proven benefits for health. The objective is to determine the protective effect of cocoa at the cellular and molecular levels in Presbycusis. For in vitro study, we used House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1), stria vascularis (SV-k1), and organ of Corti (OC-k3) cells (derived from the auditory organ of a transgenic mouse). Each cell line was divided into a control group (CTR) and an H2O2group (induction of senescence by an oxygen radical). Additionally, every group of every cell line was treated with the cocoa polyphenolic extract (CPE), measuring different markers of apoptosis, viability, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative/nitrosative stress. The data show an increase of reactive oxidative and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) in senescent cells compared to control ones. CPE treatment effectively reduced these high levels and correlated with a significant reduction in apoptosis cells by inhibiting the mitochondrial-apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, in senescence cells, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, SOD; Catalase, CAT; and Glutathione peroxidase, GPx) was recovered after CPE treatment. Administration of CPE also decreased oxidative DNA damage in the auditory senescent cells. In conclusion, CPE inhibits the activation of senescence-related apoptotic signaling by decreasing oxidative stress in auditory senescent cells.",
