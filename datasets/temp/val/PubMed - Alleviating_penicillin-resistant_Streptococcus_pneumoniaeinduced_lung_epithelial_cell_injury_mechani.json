  "abstract": "Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), for which novel treatment medicines are required, has expanded extensively due to the overuse of antibiotics. This study aimed to detect the optimal ratio of the combination of the main components based on Yinhuapinggan granules (YHPG) to generate novel treatment concepts for PRSP-induced lung injury.",
