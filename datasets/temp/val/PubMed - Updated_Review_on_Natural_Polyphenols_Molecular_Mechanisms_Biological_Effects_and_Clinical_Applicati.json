  "abstract": "Polyphenols, naturally occurring compounds found exclusively in plants, have gained significant attention for their potential in cancer prevention and treatment. These compounds are known for their antioxidant properties and are abundant in various plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, grains, and beverages. Recent studies have highlighted the broad spectrum of health benefits of polyphenols, including their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. In addition, these naturally derived compounds are increasingly important for drug discovery due to their high molecular diversity and novel biofunctionalities. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the current research and knowledge on the potential use of dietary polyphenols as bioactive compounds for the prevention and treatment of various cancers. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the anticancer properties of phenolic compounds in both laboratory and clinical settings. Furthermore, this review highlights the positive clinical outcomes associated with the use of polyphenols as anticancer agents and offers guidance for future research to advance this promising field.",
