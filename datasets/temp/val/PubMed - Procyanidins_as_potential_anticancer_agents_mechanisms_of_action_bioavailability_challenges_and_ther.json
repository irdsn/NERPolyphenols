  "title": "Procyanidins as potential anticancer agents: mechanisms of action, bioavailability challenges and therapeutic opportunities.",
  "abstract": "Procyanidins (PCs), dietary polyphenols found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages, exhibit potent anticancer properties. Their mechanisms of action involve modulating oxidative stress, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and preventing tumor progression. Despite promising preclinical and clinical findings, their therapeutic potential remains underexplored. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the anticancer properties of PCs, including their bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety. A systematic literature search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, utilizing Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and specific keywords. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria, focusing on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence. PCs demonstrate anticancer effects through multiple pathways, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways, and regulation of apoptosis-related proteins such as BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and caspases. PCs demonstrate anticancer effects through multiple pathways, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways, and regulation of apoptosis-related proteins such as BAX, BCL-2, and caspases. However, their low oral bioavailability and metabolic instability pose challenges for clinical application. Current research highlights the need for novel delivery systems, such as nanoparticles and liposomes, to enhance systemic absorption and therapeutic efficacy. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the potential of PCs as adjuvants in cancer therapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Future studies should focus on optimizing their pharmacokinetics, exploring synergistic effects with existing treatments, and conducting large-scale clinical trials to validate their efficacy and safety. PCs hold promise as natural anticancer agents, with the potential to complement conventional therapies and improve patient outcomes.",
