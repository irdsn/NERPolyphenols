  "abstract": "Liubao insect tea (LIT) is a traditional tea produced from the excreta of Hydrillodes repugnalis that are fed with Liubao tea. In this study, LIT polyphenols (LITP) were extracted and identified, mainly consisting of brevifolin carboxylic acid, brevifolin, ellagic acid. The study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of LITP in experimental colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium in mice. LITP treatment effectively mitigated colitis symptoms, including body weight loss, diarrhoea and haematochezia, etc. Furthermore, LITP treatment significantly increased colon length, attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration and mucosal damage, safeguarded the integrity of the epithelial cell barrier, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines levels. Noteworthy alterations in the abundance of gut microbiota community were also observed, with increases in beneficial bacteria Akkermansia, Clostridia_UCG-014, and decreases in harmful bacteria Turicibacter and Erysipelatoclostridium. In conclusion, LITP exerted alleviative effects on colitis via fortifying intestinal barrier and modulating the intestinal microbiota.",
