  "abstract": "Eucalyptus camaldulensisof the Myrtaceae family shows high resistance to aluminum (Al) ions and contains various compounds such as steroids, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids, and tannins. Although the ellagitannin oenothein B (12) isolated fromE. camaldulensisexhibits remarkable properties for Al detoxification, likely contributing to its Al resistance, other ellagitannin oligomers present inE. camaldulensishave not been investigated in detail. In this study, novel dimeric and trimeric ellagitannin oligomers eucarpanin D2(1) and eucamalin A (2), together with known gallotannins (7,8, and10), monomeric ellagitannins (4-6, and11), and dimeric ellagitannins (3,9, and12-14), were isolated fromE. camaldulensisleaves. The structures of these novel compounds were elucidated based on their chemical and physicochemical properties, including the orientations of tergalloyl groups in compounds1and2. Similar to compound12, previously isolated from the roots ofE. camaldulensis, the ellagitannins demonstrated good Al detoxification properties. Hence, these tannins may play a critical role in the high Al resistance ofE. camaldulensisin acidic soils. This paper reports for the first time the isolation of ellagitannin oligomers from the leaves ofE. camaldulensis.",
