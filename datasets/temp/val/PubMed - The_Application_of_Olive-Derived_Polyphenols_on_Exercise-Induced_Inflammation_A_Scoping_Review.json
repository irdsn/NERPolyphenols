  "title": "The Application of Olive-Derived Polyphenols on Exercise-Induced Inflammation: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "There is current scientific interest pertaining to the therapeutic effects of olive-derived polyphenols (ODPs), in particular their associated anti-inflammatory properties, following the wealth of research surrounding the physiological impact of the Mediterranean Diet (MD). Despite this association, the majority of the current literature investigates ODPs in conjunction with metabolic diseases. There is limited research focusing on ODPs and acute inflammation following exercise, regardless of the knowledge surrounding the elevated inflammatory response during this time. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to understand the impact ODPs may have on exercise-induced inflammation.",
