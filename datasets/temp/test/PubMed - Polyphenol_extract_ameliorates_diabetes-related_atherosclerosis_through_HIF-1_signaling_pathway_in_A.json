  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus promotes atherosclerosis (AS), a major cause of cardiovascular disease. Statins, clinical drugs for AS treatment, may increase the risk of diabetes and induce hepatotoxicity. Polyphenols can alleviate AS by exerting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and play a role in liver protection. However, the effects of polyphenol extract (PE) on diabetic AS and whether PE can assist atorvastatin in managing diabetic AS with additional benefits remain poorly understood.",
