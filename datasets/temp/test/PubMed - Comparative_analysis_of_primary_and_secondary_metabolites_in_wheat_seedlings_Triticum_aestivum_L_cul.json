  "abstract": "To elucidate the impact of environmental factors on the nutritional quality of metabolites in wheat seedlings, both primary and secondary metabolites must be comprehensively examined. We thus conducted a comparative analysis of these metabolites in wheat seedlings grown under various photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) (200, 400 and 800 μmol m-2s-1) and growth periods (5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 days) to help optimize the nutritional quality of seedlings.",
