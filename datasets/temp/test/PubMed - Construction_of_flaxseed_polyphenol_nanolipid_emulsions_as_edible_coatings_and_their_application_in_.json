  "abstract": "Flaxseed polyphenols exhibited antibacterial and antioxidant properties; however, their poor solubility and stability limited their application in food products. Incorporation into nano-emulsions improved their dissolution and encapsulation. This study evaluated the stability of flaxseed polyphenol nano-emulsions, formulated with chitosan, lactoferrin, glyceryl monocaprate, and flaxseed gum (FP-CTS-FG, FP-LF-FG,FP-GM-FG), over 28 days of storage, heating at 60/80/100 °C, and freeze-thaw cycles at -20 °C. The initial zeta potentialof these three emulsions are all greater than 30 mV, and the particle sizes are less than 500 nm. Minimal changes in particle size, zeta potential, and phase behavior, along with reduced surface tension and droplet aggregation, indicated good stability. When used as a coating for spiced beef, the emulsion reduced moisture loss, inhibited microbial growth, and delayed lipid oxidation and quality deterioration. Overall, our findings provided new insights and avenues for the application of flaxseed polyphenols in the food industry.",
