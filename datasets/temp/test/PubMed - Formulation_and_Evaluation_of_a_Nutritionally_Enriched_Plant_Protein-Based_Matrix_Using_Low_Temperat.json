  "title": "Formulation and Evaluation of a Nutritionally Enriched Plant Protein-Based Matrix Using Low Temperature Extrusion Cooking-Air Drying Technology.",
  "abstract": "Extrusion cooking is broadly used in the food industry due to its easiness and simplicity. In this study a twin-screw extruder is applied at 150 rpm and 24-28 °C for the production of a nutritionally enriched extruded matrix, where hypo-allergenic rice protein (RP) and pea protein (PP) were used in the entrapment of natural antioxidant blueberry powder. The higher-moisture-content extrusion (40% MC) used with protein mixture (75 PP:25 RP) reduced the output temperature from 61.97 °C to 55 °C, the expansion ratio from 1.26 to 1, and the rehydration ratio from 78.70% to 31.90%, when compared with low-moisture-content extrusion used with RP samples (25% MC). Combining RP and PP showed also an enhancement in the textural properties of the extruded samples where firmness and toughness increased to 1503 (g) and 1822 (g.s), respectively, and preserved the anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity during extrusion processing and subsequent finish air drying. Moreover, the addition of maltodextrin in low concentration (5%) enhanced the antioxidant activity and anthocyanin retention (by 98.59% in mixture samples after extrusion and 92.13% after drying) and improved the appearance and sensory properties of the extruded matrices including firmness, toughness, and the color of the added blueberry powder.",
