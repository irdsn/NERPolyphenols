  "abstract": "The pathogenicity ofCandidaspp. poses a persistent challenge, particularly in hospital environments where these species proliferate and cause opportunistic infections. Many strains have developed resistance to commonly used antifungal agents, including azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins, complicating treatment, especially in immuno-compromised patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying antifungal resistance, such as mutations in genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, efflux pump activity, and enzymatic pathways, is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Given the challenges associated with discovering new antifungal agents, medicinal plants have emerged as a promising source of bioactive compounds with anti-Candidaactivity. Secondary metabolites, including terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, exhibit various mechanisms of action, such as biofilm inhibition, membrane disruption, and oxidative stress induction. However, challenges such as extract standardization, and the lack of clinical studies continue to limit their therapeutic application. This review underscores the potential of medicinal plants as complementary or alternative strategies to conventional antifungal therapies, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary research to overcome these hurdles and harness the therapeutic potential of natural products.",
