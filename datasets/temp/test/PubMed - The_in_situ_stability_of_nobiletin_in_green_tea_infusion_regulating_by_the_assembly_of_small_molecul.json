  "title": "The in situ stability of nobiletin in green tea infusion regulating by the assembly of small molecules.",
  "abstract": "Abandoning the traditional way of constructing delivery carriers with structural materials, the natural food system is used as the steady-state basis of functional factors. This study innovatively proposes directly using the original green tea infusion, rich in tea polyphenols, to construct a stable system, thereby achieving the efficient loading and long-term stability of nobiletin (NOB). Specifically, the concentration of NOB in the system reaches up to 1 mg/mL, with an encapsulation rate and loading rate exceeding 95 % and 75 %, respectively. Importantly, it is found that the assembly of key small molecules EGCG and caffeine achieves NOB homeostasis. Moreover, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction are the main forces stabilizing the assembly, and the binding ratio of NOB to EGCG and Caffeine is 1:0.4 and 1:1.2, separately. The design strategy is expected to provide a new idea for the directional design of healthier future food.",
