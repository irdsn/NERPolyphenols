  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumours and is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite the availability of preventative, diagnostic and treatment methods including endoscopic treatment, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, biologics, salvage therapy and immunotherapy, the mortality rate associated with CRC remains alarming. Consequently, there is a pressing need to search for medicines for the treatment of CRC. Phytomedicines have been shown to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of CRC through various mechanisms, including immune regulation, modulation of gut microbiota, targeting of stem cells, macrophage polarisation, glycolysis, ferroptosis induction, modulation of extracellular vesicles, activation of mitochondria-induced apoptosis, inflammation reduction, oxidative stress management and intervention of autophagy. Furthermore, numerous studies have reported the anti-cancer and anti-metastatic effects of various phytomedicines, including curcumin, resveratrol, berberine, shikonin, dihydroartemisinin, fucoidan, luteolin, andrographolide, piperine, kaempferol, emodin, cannabidiol, tanshinone IIA and evodiamine. In this review, we sort out the effects and mechanisms of phytomedicines on CRC and outline the major phytomedicines commonly used in CRC treatment. We hope that these phytomedicines may serve as promising drugs or important lead compounds for the management of CRC.",
