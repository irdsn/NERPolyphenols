  "abstract": "Background:Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the major contributors to platelet storage lesions. Addition of antioxidant additives to storage solutions can mitigate oxidative damage to platelets. Caffeic acid (CA) is a polyphenolic compound that directly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibits lipid peroxidation, and modulates platelet function signaling pathways. This is the first study to investigate the influence of CA on stored platelets.Methodology:Platelets obtained from the blood of maleWistarrats (n= 5 per group) were resuspended in SSP+ combined with plasma at 70:30 ratio. ROS was analyzed during a 7-day storage period for different concentrations of CA. The concentration of CA that exhibited maximum inhibition was chosen for further studies. Platelets (n= 5) were divided into (1) controls and (2) CA and stored at 22°C under mild agitation for 11 days. The markers of platelet function, viability, OS, and antioxidant defenses were analyzed.Results:CA at 5 µM concentration (5-CA) showed maximum inhibition of ROS on day 7; hence, was chosen for further assays. 5-CA augmented antioxidant defenses, decreased lipid peroxidation, and scavenged superoxide radicals compared with controls. Decline in platelet activation, aggregation without collagen, and microbial contamination were also observed in 5-CA. Platelet viability and metabolism were maintained; lactate dehydrogenase decreased by the end of storage in 5-CA.Conclusion:5-CA in SSP+ could preserve the quality of stored platelets until day 7 of storage. This study emphasizes the potential of CA as an additive in platelet storage solutions in prolonging the shelf-life of platelets and maintaining their efficacy.",
