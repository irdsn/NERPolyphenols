  "abstract": "Wine flavor complexity arises from interactions among over 1000 volatile compounds, with esters, thiols, and terpenes being key contributors. This review comprehensively examines the complex interactions among aroma compounds in wine, emphasizing their role in shaping wine flavor profiles. These interactions, occurring at the physicochemical, olfactory receptor, and neural levels, can either enhance or mask sensory perceptions, significantly influencing wine quality. Non-volatile compounds, such as polyphenols and polysaccharides, also play a critical role by modulating aroma volatility through interactions like π-π stacking and hydrophobic bonding. The review evaluates current methodologies, including sensory analysis and instrumental techniques, and emphasizes the need for advanced models to predict interaction outcomes. Notably, within a 2%-10% ethanol concentration range, \"positive odor intensity\" and \"positive aroma persistence\" increase with ethanol levels, illustrating the complex relationship between matrix components and sensory perception. Crossmodal interactions between aroma and taste further complicate flavor perception, with aromas like vanilla enhancing sweetness perception in white wines. However, research on red wines remains inconclusive, suggesting the need for further investigation. Future research should focus on real wine matrices, leveraging machine learning and interdisciplinary approaches to model complex interactions. Expanding studies to other alcoholic beverages and exploring the physiological mechanisms of crossmodal interactions could enhance flavor design and sensory optimization in the food industry, offering significant academic and practical value.",
