  "title": "Quercetin as a Therapeutic Option in a Rat Model of Aluminum Chloride- and D-Galactose-Induced Neurodegeneration.",
  "abstract": "Aluminum (Al) is one of the most abundant metals on Earth and is well known as an environmental neurotoxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Aluminum toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, reduction of antioxidant enzymes, and disruption of the balance of cellular metals, such as iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), and copper (Cu), which causes structural and functional changes in the nervous tissue of the brain or peripheral nervous system. The intake of functional foods, rich in antioxidants, such as quercetin, may be beneficial in combating oxidative stress and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to provide deeper insight into the cellular and molecular neuroprotective effects of quercetin in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation in the Al/D-galactose-induced rat model (Al/D-gal) of AD. The results showed that quercetin successfully modulated the impaired homeostatic and neuropathological consequences of aluminum chloride and D-galactose administration over 28 days: it directly protected neurons by regulating the level of oxidative stress and antioxidants, reduced Aβ aggregation by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), increased the survival, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells by maintaining the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and regulated microglial immunoreactivity and neuroinflammation by reducing the level of proinflammatory cytokines. The multiple effects confirm that quercetin can be applied as an alternative non-pharmaceutical approach in reducing Al-induced neurotoxicity and maintaining adaptive homeostasis, which consequently affects the functioning of the central nervous system and the whole organism.",
