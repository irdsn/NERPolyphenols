  "abstract": "Genetic breeding is essential to develop grapevine genotypes adapted to warm climates and resistant to pathogens. Traditionally cultivated Vitis vinifera is susceptible to biotic and abiotic stresses. Winemakers and consumers, however, perceive wines from non-vinifera or hybrid cultivars as inferior. In this study, sensory analyses and comprehensive metabolite profiling by targeted and untargeted approaches were used to investigate the oenological potential of wines from grapes of genotypes developed throughout four breeding cycles to improve climate adaptation, sugar contents and berry color.",
