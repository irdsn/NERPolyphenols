  "abstract": "Anthocyanins have various health benefits but are limited by fast elimination and low bioavailability. Many studies have shown that nano delivery systems are effective in improving the intestinal absorption and bioavailability of anthocyanins. However, in the process of selecting anthocyanin nanomaterials, a dilemma is faced: numerous functional nanomaterials lack edible properties, it is difficult to meet the edible and functional requirements of nanomaterials simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary and inevitable to select nano-anthocyanin carriers that are edible and have certain functional and morphological characteristics.",
