  "abstract": "Obesity and high fasting blood glucose (FBG) resulting from high-fat diets (HFDs) have emerged as significant public health concerns, garnering increasing attention. Recently, gut microbiota has been linked with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and its mediating role in dietary supplements has been confirmed. Seeking various dietary supplements to lose body weight (BW) and decrease FBG and explaining the underlying mechanism have become the research hotspots in T2DM studies.",
