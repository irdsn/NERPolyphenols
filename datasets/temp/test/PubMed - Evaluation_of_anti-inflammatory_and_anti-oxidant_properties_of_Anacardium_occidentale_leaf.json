  "abstract": "Inflammation is a critical factor in various chronic diseases, and the search for natural anti-inflammatory agents has gained attention. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory potential of Anacardium occidentale (cashew) leaf extract. A preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of bioactive compounds, with alkaloids (1.667 ± 0.004 mg/ml) and saponins (1.568 ± 0.001 mg/ml) as the most abundant. These compounds, along with flavonoids, phenolics, terpenoids, and steroids, are known for their pharmacological properties, including inflammation modulation. The study utilized various antioxidant assays, including DPPH, FRAP, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), which demonstrated significant radical scavenging activity, indicating the extract's potential to reduce oxidative stress-induced inflammation. The ethanol extract exhibited notable inhibition of protein denaturation, protease activity, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide scavenging, and phospholipase A2(PLA2) activity, supporting its anti-inflammatory potential. Molecular docking analysis revealed strong binding interactions between the plant's phytochemicals and key inflammatory proteins, with flavone, myricetin, and catechin displaying superior binding affinity compared to standard anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac and ibuprofen. These findings suggest that A. occidentale leaf extract possesses significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, likely due to its rich phytochemical composition. The extract's ability to inhibit key inflammatory pathways highlights its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for managing inflammation-related diseases such as arthritis, asthma, neuro-inflammation, and metabolic disorders. Further clinical studies are recommended to validate its efficacy and explore its potential integration into conventional medicine.",
