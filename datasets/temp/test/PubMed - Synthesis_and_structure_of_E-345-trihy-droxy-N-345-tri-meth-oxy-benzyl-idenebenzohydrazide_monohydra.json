  "abstract": "In the structure of the title compound, C17H18N2O7Â·H2O, hydrogen bonds link three mol-ecules to the water mol-ecule. Additional hydrogen-bonding inter-actions connect two mol-eculesviathe amide nitro-gen donor and two meth-oxy oxygen acceptors. This three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network has no particular directionality, and a slight disorder of two meth-oxy groups is observed. According to force-field calculations, weaker but more extended van der Waals inter-actions show a larger stabilization effect than the hydrogen-bond inter-actions, while hydrogen-bond analysis suggests that polymorphs of the compound may be found in the future.",
