  "abstract": "Olive mill wastewater (OMWW) was used in ferti-irrigation due to its high water content, as well as its organic and mineral richness. However, this by-product also contains elevated levels of polyphenols, which may pose phytotoxic risks to soil microbiota and plants over time. To address this concern, we conducted a thorough examination of the phenolic composition of OMWW and the phenolic content of amended soils using HPLC analysis. Additionally, we assessed the residual phytotoxicity of OMWW across various soil rhizospheric layers (0-30 cm, 30-60 cm, and 60-90 cm). Standard germination tests were performed using soil extracts with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seeds. We also measured α-amylase activities in the germinated seeds for both species, comparing them to raw OMWW and control soil extracts. HPLC analysis revealed that tyrosol, ferulic acid, and hydroxytyrosol were the predominant phenolic compounds in crude OMWW, while no detectable compounds were found in the soil extracts. Germination tests indicated minimal toxicity in the topsoil amended with OMWW, with a noticeable reduction in residual phytotoxicity at greater depths. These results aligned with the α-amylase activity assessments, which demonstrated significantly higher enzyme activity in the deeper soil layers (30-60 cm and 60-90 cm), with no substantial differences compared to control extracts.",
