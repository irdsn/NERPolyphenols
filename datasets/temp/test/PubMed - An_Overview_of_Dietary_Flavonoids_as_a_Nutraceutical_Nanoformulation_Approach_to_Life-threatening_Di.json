  "abstract": "Obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are just a few chronic diseases for which proper nutrition has been demonstrated to be a crucial factor in prevention. Flavonoids, found in many fruits and vegetables, are a type of dietary polyphenol with potent antioxidant activity and anti-carcinogenic characteristics. Flavonoids and foods rich in flavonoids have been shown in recent years to have profound effects on cognitive function, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Foods high in flavonoids, such as green tea, chocolate, blueberries, and other fruits and vegetables, have ameliorated symptoms of cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia in several animal models. As a result of their ability to prevent neuronal death generated by neurotoxic chemicals such as free radicals and Î²-amyloid proteins. Furthermore, flavonoids are also effective in slowing the evolution of clinical signs of neurodegenerative illnesses. In addition, flavonoids can improve lipid profiles by preventing the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, and these antioxidant capabilities are responsible for their therapeutic impacts. Finally, the potential of flavonoids to induce vasodilation and control apoptotic processes in the endothelium is another way in which they benefit the cardiovascular system. This review aims to offer up-to-date information on categorizing these compounds, their primary methods of action in the human body, and their positive impacts on the management of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and other life-threatening diseases.",
