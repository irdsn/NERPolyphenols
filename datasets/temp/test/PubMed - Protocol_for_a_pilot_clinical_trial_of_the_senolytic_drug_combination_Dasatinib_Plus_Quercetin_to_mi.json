  "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia are linked to accelerated aging leading to reduced lifespan, health span and cognitive decline. Cellular senescence, in which cells lose proliferative capacity and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), plays a role in this process. Emerging research suggests that the senolytic regimen of dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q) reduces senescent cells, potentially mitigating age-related health and cognitive decline. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of D+Q in older adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD).",
