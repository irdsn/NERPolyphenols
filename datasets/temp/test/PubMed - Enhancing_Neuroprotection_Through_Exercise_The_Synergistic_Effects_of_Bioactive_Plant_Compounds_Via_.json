  "abstract": "The hippocampus, a vital brain region, orchestrates numerous critical functions including memory, learning, stress response, and emotional regulation. Structural changes in the hippocampus due to prolonged stress exposure can precipitate cognitive decline and behavioral deficits. Recent studies have illuminated the restorative influence of physical fitness on the hippocampus; notably, exercise enhances memory, learning, hippocampal architecture, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. A key mediator in these processes is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which facilitates synaptic improvements and overall brain health following exercise. Concurrently, bioactive plant compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and crocin have emerged as potent therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders, credited with improving memory, synaptic plasticity, and overall brain function, without the adverse effects associated with synthetic drugs. These natural compounds potentially exert their neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms including neurotransmitter regulation, oxidative stress alleviation, and stimulation of the BDNF-cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Given the individual benefits of exercise and bioactive plant compounds, this review proposes a synergistic approach combining both modalities, aimed at developing novel, efficacious neuroprotective interventions. By harnessing the intertwined benefits of physical activity and plant-derived therapies, we outline a compelling case for their combined utility in fortifying hippocampal function and combating neurodegenerative conditions. In this review, we combined the benefits of exercise and therapy with bioactive plant components to create a neuroprotective drug.",
