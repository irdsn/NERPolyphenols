  "title": "Apigenin and treating bladder cancer: a mini-review of the current literature.",
  "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) is a significant global public health concern, affecting a large number of people worldwide. Therefore, discovering effective strategies for its prevention and treatment is crucial to minimise its impact. Apigenin is a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables. Studies have shown its effectiveness in treating various types of cancer. This review summarises the mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of apigenin in treating BC. According to our findings, apigenin affects various signalling pathways and numerous protein families, including p53, caspase, PARP, cytochrome c, Bcl-2, PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, JNK, AP-1, NF-ÎºB, MAPK, MEKK1, and TRAIL, leading to cell death and inhibition of proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Thus, apigenin may represent a promising therapeutic approach for BC. However, the encouraging preclinical data should be evaluated in clinical settings through further studies, with appropriate methods and enhanced drug delivery systems.",
