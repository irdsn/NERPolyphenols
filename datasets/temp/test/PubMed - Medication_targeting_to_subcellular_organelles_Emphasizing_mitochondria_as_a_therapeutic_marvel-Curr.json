  "abstract": "Subcellular disorders are linked with several diseases, specifically mitochondrial dysfunction linked to age, metabolic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other mitochondrial diseases (MDs). Intracellular medication delivery is a promising option for effective therapy. This study aims to highlight subcellular delivery with focus on mitochondrial pharmacology, gene therapy, transplantation, and drug targeting. PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and other scholarly sources were leveraged to prepare this narrative review. According to current studies, intermittent fasting, consistent exercise, well-balanced diets, and proper sleep can all help to increase mitochondrial quality. Molecular therapies improve mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox status, biogenesis, dynamics, mitophagy, bioenergetic, and sirtuins. The antioxidant supplementation restores endogenous antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid, tocopherols, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10 to prevent mitochondrial damage. Mdivi-1, melatonin, resveratrol, PGC-1Î± agonists, metformin, and Opa1 activators modify the dynamics and biogenesis of mitochondria. Bioactive phytochemicals, including curcumin, berberine, quercetin, and capsaicin, affect OXPHOS and mitochondrial sirtuins. These agents affect gene expression, antioxidant defenses, inflammation, and mitochondrion functions. Therefore, bioactive phytochemicals limit oxidative damage, increase insulin sensitivity, and improve extended cell longevity. Mitochondrial transplantation and gene therapy using mRNA and gene editing technologies are promising treatment options for MDs. Mitoquidone, triphenylphosphine, mitochondrial-targeting peptides, and nanocarriers localize medicines within mitochondrial compartments. In conclusion, a good lifestyle and bioactive materials, alongside mitochondrial medications, gene therapy, transplantation, and drug targeting, could restore overall cellular health.",
