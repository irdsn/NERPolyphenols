  "abstract": "Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is commonly employed for fining in fruit wine brewing. This study aimed to investigate the impact of PVPP pretreatment on the formation of fermentation aroma and polyphenol distribution in Rosa roxburghii Tratt (RRT) wine. A significant effect of PVPP on polyphenol adsorption was observed, and polyphenol families or subfamilies such as flavanols and flavonols showed specific affinity for PVPP, decreasing by over 19 % and 30 %, respectively. Furthermore, it was the first time to demonstrate a significant enhancement in the ester content of the corresponding RRT wine after PVPP treatment, particularly in imparting sweet and fruity esters (increased by over 40 %). In contrast, the RRT wine treated with PVPP exhibited a significant reduction of over 20 % in the concentration of higher alcohols, particularly reflected in the green and chemical aromas. This indicates that PVPP treatment could promote the transformation of RRT wine aroma from green and chemical to sweet and fruity. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the concentration of higher alcohols and most phenolic compounds in RRT wine, while quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin, and polydatin were negatively correlated with esters that can impart fruit flavor and floral aroma to fruit wine. As a practical insight into fruit wine fermentation, PVPP fining before fermentation is more likely to alter the phenolic compositions of RRT wine, thereby influencing its aroma characteristics. Specifically, polyphenols associated with energy metabolism of yeast could have stimulated the formed fluxes of esters. The association between the formation of esters and higher alcohols with phenolic compounds will provide new information on the impact of clarification treatments on yeast-derived volatile metabolites in RRT wine and hold promise in improving the aroma of RRT wine by modulating polyphenol composition through pre-clarification.",
