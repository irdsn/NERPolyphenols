  "abstract": "Chronic urticaria (CU), a prevalent and often debilitating allergic skin disorder, is primarily triggered by mast cell degranulation. Danggui Yinzi (DGYZ), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been employed to treat pruritic conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects in CU remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the immunopharmacological mechanisms of DGYZ in CU, hypothesizing that it modulates immune responses through its bioactive components, which is critical for the development of novel therapeutic agents.",
