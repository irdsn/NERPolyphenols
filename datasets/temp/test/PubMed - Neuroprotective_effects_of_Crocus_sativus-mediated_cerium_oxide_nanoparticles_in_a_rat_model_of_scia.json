  "title": "Neuroprotective effects of Crocus sativus-mediated cerium oxide nanoparticles in a rat model of sciatic nerve crush injury.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed at integrating the outstanding medicinal traits of Crocus sativus L. (saffron) with ceria nanoparticles (CeO2NPs) to assess the neuroprotective potential of their combination in rats with nerve crush injury. With this aim, ceria NPs were prepared using saffron extract (S-CeO2), and the acquired nanoceria were characterized via XRD, DRS, FTIR, SEM, and TGA and compared to the traits of the nanoceria prepared in the absence of saffron extract (CeO2). The GC-MS analysis was also conducted to reveal the bioactive compounds of the saffron extract. Subsequently, comparative studies were carried out on the motor nerve recovery effectiveness of the nanoceria samples on the peripheral nerve injury model rats using sciatic functional index and walking track analysis. Later, the hot plate test was performed to assess the pain-like behavior and subsequent sensory recovery of the sciatic nerve of the rats under study. The atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscles of the sacrificed rats was then studied using the muscle mass ratio values. In the end, the physiological conditions of the myelin sheath, nerve fiber, and muscle recovery were analyzed via histological morphometric patterns. As per the results, the postoperative administration with S-CeO2accelerated peripheral nerve regeneration and improved the recovery of motor function, which could potentially be due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the engaged constituents. Altogether, our findings emphasize the therapeutic potential of ceria nanoparticles encompassing the phytomolecules of the saffron extract in addressing neurological disorders, thereby enabling the development of cutting-edge therapies.",
