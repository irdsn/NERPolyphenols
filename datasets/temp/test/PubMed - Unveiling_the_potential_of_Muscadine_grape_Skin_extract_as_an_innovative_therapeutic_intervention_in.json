  "abstract": "The use of muscadine grape extracts (MGSE). in cancer treatment has gained attention due to its distinctive composition of polyphenols and antioxidants. This review analyses the reported anti-cancer properties of MGSE. The study commences by reviewing the phytochemical composition of MGSE, highlighting the presence of resveratrol and ellagic acid. Furthermore, the review underscores the mechanism of action of these active compounds in MGSE in combating cancer cells. The anti-cancer potential of MGSE compared to other plant extracts is also discussed. In addition, it highlights MGSE's superiority and distinct phytochemical composition in preventing cancer growth by comparing its anti-cancer compounds with those of other anti-cancer medicinal plants. Lastly, the combinatory approaches of MGSE with traditional cancer therapies, its safety, and its possible side effects were highlighted. This work provides an understanding of the anti-cancer properties of MGSE, positioning it as a valuable and unique challenge within the field of cancer therapy.",
