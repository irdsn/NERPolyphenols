  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health issue characterized by glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels and insufficient insulin production by the pancreatic β-cells. This dysfunction triggers a chronic inflammatory immune response. Given the documented benefits of medicinal plants in managing diabetic complications and the therapeutic potential ofPeriploca laevigataAiton (PL) extracts, this study evaluated their antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties using the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1E under hyperglycemic conditions. Root, fruit, and Leaf extracts of PL were prepared, phytochemically characterized, and assessed for anti-inflammatory effects via RT-qPCR in glucose-treated INS-1E cells. A non-cytotoxic concentration (0.125 mg/mL) was selected for all assays. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins and flavonoids, compounds associated with antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activity. Notably, PL extracts upregulated insulin gene expression, with Leaf extracts exhibiting the most pronounced effects: they significantly enhanced GLUT-2 and PDX-1 gene expression in glucose-treated INS-1E cells. Additionally, PL extracts downregulated iNOS while upregulating IL-10 gene expression. A trend toward reduced NF-κB and MCP-1 gene expression was also observed. Collectively, these results suggest that PL extracts could improve pancreatic β-cell function and mitigate inflammation, highlighting their potential as adjunct therapy for T2D.",
