  "abstract": "Drought is the most complex and devastating abiotic stress that limits yield and quality attributes. Metabolites produced are the biochemical indicators of any type of stressed imposed on plant system. In the present study the ameliorative effect of seed priming and foliar application of 0.25 % chitosan was evaluated on red kidney bean variety grown under induced drought stress. Seed bio-priming resulted in increase in total reducing sugar and free amino acid (23.88 ± 0.21 and 8.18 ± 0.02 mg/g DW contents, respectively). The higher value of IC50for α-amylase (67.40 ± 0.01 mg/ml) and α-glucosidase (30.92 ± 0.01 mg/ml) inhibition activity was observed in the seeds obtained from the treatment SP20. Proanthocyanidin in seeds was observed in the range of 0.71-1.53 mg/g DW across treatments. Chitosan-treated plants exhibited increased chlorophyll, proline with enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, Proline dehydrogenase and Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase and reduced malondialdehyde content. The LC-MS analysis revealed 15 sugars and 21 amino acids in the seed samples. This study highlights the potential of chitosan bio-priming in imparting drought tolerance. It also aligns with sustainable development goals and offers a sustainable approach to improving red kidney bean productivity and nutritional quality under water-limited conditions.",
