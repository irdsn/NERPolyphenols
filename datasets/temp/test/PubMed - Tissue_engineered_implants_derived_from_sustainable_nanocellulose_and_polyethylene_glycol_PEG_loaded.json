  "abstract": "Nanocellulose-based sustainable tissue engineering implants are becoming the most promising dressings because of their superior drug loading capacity, structure mimicking the extracellular matrix, and biocompatibility. However, the therapeutic impact and functionality of current wound dressings are severely limited due to their low breathability, poor environmental adaptation, potential for drug resistance, and limited pharmacological alternatives. This study aimed to develop a PEG-nanocellulose submicron fibrous scaffold from sugarcane bagasse, incorporating polyphenols from H. alternata leaf extract. The polyphenols were screened using HR-LCMS analysis followed by in silico studies and HPLC quantification. The phytochemicals were selected based on biological activities, binding energy, and LCMS score. The prepared scaffolds were optimized using physical, mechanical, and chemical characterization techniques. The in vitro cytocompatibility and wound healing efficacy of the modified implant were assessed using L929 fibroblast cell lines. NCF scaffolds' tissue engineering potential was evaluated using confocal fluorescence imaging. The in vivo implantation of the scaffolds revealed that PEG: NCF-8%HA scaffolds exhibited significant wound-healing activity. Additionally, these scaffolds demonstrated promising cytocompatibility (98.3 ± 2.99), good blood compatibility (0.43 ± 0.02), and excellent wound closure (100 %). The histopathology studies also suggested that the implants showed good biocompatibility, promoted better angiogenesis, and resulted in a low tissue inflammation response.",
