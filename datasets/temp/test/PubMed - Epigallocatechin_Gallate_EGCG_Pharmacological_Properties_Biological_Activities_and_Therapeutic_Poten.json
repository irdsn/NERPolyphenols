  "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the predominant catechin in green tea, comprises approximately 50% of its total polyphenol content and has garnered widespread recognition for its significant therapeutic potential. As the principal bioactive component ofCamellia sinensis, EGCG is celebrated for its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and antitumor properties. The bioavailability and metabolism of EGCG within the gut microbiota underscore its systemic effects, as it is absorbed in the intestine, metabolized into bioactive compounds, and transported to target organs. This compound has been shown to influence key physiological pathways, particularly those related to lipid metabolism and inflammation, offering protective effects against a variety of diseases. EGCG's ability to modulate cell signaling pathways associated with oxidative stress, apoptosis, and immune regulation highlights its multifaceted role in health promotion. Emerging evidence underscores EGCG's therapeutic potential in preventing and managing a range of chronic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. Given the growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases and the increasing interest in natural compounds, EGCG presents a promising avenue for novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on EGCG, emphasizing its critical role as a versatile natural bioactive agent with diverse clinical applications. Further exploration in both experimental and clinical settings is essential to fully unlock its therapeutic potential.",
