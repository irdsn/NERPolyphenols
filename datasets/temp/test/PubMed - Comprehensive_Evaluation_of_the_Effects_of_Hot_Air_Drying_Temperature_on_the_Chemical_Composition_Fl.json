  "abstract": "This study systematically investigated the drying kinetics and quality characteristics ofHouttuynia cordata Thunb.(HCT) under different processing conditions, evaluating how freeze-drying and hot-air drying (40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C) affect bioactive compound preservation, antioxidant efficacy, and metabolic profiles to identify the optimal drying method for maximizing its functional benefits. A thin-layer drying model was established to evaluate drying parameters such as effective diffusion coefficient and activation energy. Changes in chemical composition, sensory properties, and antioxidant activity were analyzed using UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS, electronic nose/tongue, and HepG2 cell assays. Results showed that the Aghabashlo model was optimal for demonstrating the drying process with the best fit. The 50 °C heating temperature was shown to yield the highest diffusion coefficient. Hot-air drying at 50 °C balanced efficiency and sensory quality, whereas 60 °C significantly altered flavor and metabolite composition. Results of the metabolomic analysis indicated that freeze-drying enhanced the retention of phenolic acids and flavonoids, while hot-air drying led to increased fatty acid metabolites. Freeze-drying preserved the antioxidant activity and natural flavor of HCT. Nevertheless, the metabolic fate of rutin, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid was not significantly affected by the drying method (freeze-drying vs. 50 °C drying). These findings provide a theoretical foundation for improving HCT's therapeutic and sensory qualities through optimized drying techniques.",
