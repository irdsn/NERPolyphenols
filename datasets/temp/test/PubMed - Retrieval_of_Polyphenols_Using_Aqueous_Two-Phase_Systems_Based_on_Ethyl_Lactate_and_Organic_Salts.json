  "abstract": "Food waste remains a critical global concern, with approximately one third of all food produced being ultimately discarded. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new techniques for the effective repurpose of waste. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) stand out as a simple and biocompatible liquid-liquid extraction technique for the recovery of bioactive substances from food waste. In ATPSs, the target species partition between two liquid phases, according to affinity, which facilitates its extraction. This work aimed at extracting three polyphenols-chlorogenic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and resveratrol (RV)-through the application of eco-friendly ATPSs composed of water, ethyl lactate (EL), and organic salts, namely disodium succinate (Na2Succinate) and disodium tartrate (Na2Tartrate), for future application in the valorisation of food waste. All partitions presented successful results, with values of partition coefficients (K) higher than 1 and extraction efficiencies (E) higher than 50%, indicating a preferential migration of the polyphenols to the top phase. The extraction of FA using the ATPS based on Na2Tartrate presented the most promising results, withK= 19 ± 6 andE= (94.2 ± 0.9)% for the longest tie-line. Additionally, a comparison with previous works of the research group was drawn, with the extraction of RV exhibiting outstanding performance across all studied ATPSs. Therefore, the assessed ATPSs were shown to hold immense potential for the recovery of polyphenols.",
