  "abstract": "Chenopodium album or Bathua is a very important and nutritious herb found abundantly in temperate and tropical countries. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of its bioactive composition, pharmacological properties, and therapeutic potential. A thorough literature review was performed to encompass all phytochemicals like flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, rutin), alkaloids, saponins, and phenolic compounds. All of these bioactives demonstrated pronounced antioxidant, antifungal efficacies, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, nephroprotective effects, hepatoprotective properties, managing diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. C. album is a substantial source of major vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers, seriously tackling the inauspicious scenarios of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiency. The evidence gathered reinforces its potential for therapeutic application in chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and liver dysfunctions. In spite of all this, a lot of limitations surrounding research still remain, particularly in the conversion of preclinical findings into clinical applications due to the lack of clinical trials and the development of standardized formulations. Future studies need to concentrate on clinical validation, bioavailability studies, and elucidation of mechanisms to determine its efficacy and safety. There is a need for advanced analytical methods and formulation development by regulatory strategies allowing the use of C. album within functional food and pharmaceutical applications to gain their full medicinal potential.",
