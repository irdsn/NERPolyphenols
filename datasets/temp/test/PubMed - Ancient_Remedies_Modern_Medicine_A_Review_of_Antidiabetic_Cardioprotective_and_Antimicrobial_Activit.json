  "abstract": "This review critically explores the pharmacological potential of four traditionally significant medicinal plants-Phoenix dactylifera,Solanum lycopersicum,Withania somnifera, andTrigonella foenum-graecum-with a specific focus on their antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and antimicrobial properties. In light of the escalating global burden of chronic metabolic diseases and the alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance, there is an urgent demand for alternative, sustainable therapeutic strategies. Drawing upon both ethnopharmacological evidence and contemporary biomedical research, this study identifies and characterizes the key bioactive constituents responsible for the observed therapeutic effects. These phytochemicals include flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, and saponins, which modulate metabolic pathways, exert antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibit microbial proliferation. A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, covering peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2025. Inclusion criteria emphasized both in vitro and in vivo experimental models to provide a holistic understanding of molecular mechanisms and biological efficacy. Importantly, this review does not propose these plant extracts as direct substitutes for clinically established therapies but rather as potential complementary agents or sources of novel compounds for future drug development. This integrative approach underscores the relevance of traditional medicinal knowledge in guiding the discovery of plant-based therapeutics. It highlights these species as promising candidates for innovative health interventions in the context of modern biomedicine and global public health.",
