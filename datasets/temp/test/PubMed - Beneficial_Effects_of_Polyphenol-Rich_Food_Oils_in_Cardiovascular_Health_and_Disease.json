  "abstract": "A variety of vegetable and fruit derived food oils are considered beneficial for human health due to their content of functional components including their positive effects in cardiovascular system. In addition to the favorable ratio of unsaturated versus saturated fatty acids, some of these oils include also other health beneficial compounds such as vitamins, minerals, pigments, enzymes and phenolic compounds. Particularly polyphenols have been documented to exert numerous positive effects in cardiovascular system including their anti-hypertensive, anti-atherogenic as well as cardio- and vasculo- protective effects in subjects suffering from various cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, likely via their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant, anti-proliferative and anti-diabetic properties. However, it has not been proven so far whether the positive cardiovascular effects of polyphenol-rich food oils are, and to what measure, attributed to their phenolic content. Thus, the current review aims to summarize the main cardiovascular effects of major polyphenol-rich food oils including olive, flaxseed, soybean, sesame and coconut oils, and to uncover the role of their phenolic compounds in these effects.",
