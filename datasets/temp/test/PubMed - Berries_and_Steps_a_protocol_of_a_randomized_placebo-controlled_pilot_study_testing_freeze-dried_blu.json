  "abstract": "Older adults spend the majority of their day engaging in sedentary behavior, which increases risk of mortality by 22%. Despite the well-established health benefits of physical activity, a large portion of older adults remain sedentary. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation contributes to lack of motivation, which is a critical barrier to overcoming sedentary behavior in older adults. Given that inflammation is highly modifiable by diet, an anti-inflammatory dietary strategy may be a viable way to improve inflammation-driven lack of motivation and ultimately increase physical activity in sedentary older adults. However, interventions targeting such a pathway are scarce. We propose a study intervention protocol, which aims to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of daily supplementation of freeze-dried blueberries. Supplementation with blueberries provides 2 anti-inflammatory nutrients (fiber and anthocyanins) to theoretically reduce inflammation-driven lack of motivation and thereby enhance physical activity in older adults with sedentary behavior and mild depressive symptoms.",
