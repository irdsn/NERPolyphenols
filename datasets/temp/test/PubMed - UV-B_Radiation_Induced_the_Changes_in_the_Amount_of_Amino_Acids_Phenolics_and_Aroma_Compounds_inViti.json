  "abstract": "High UV-B radiation can challenge Pinot noir growth in the wine-making region of the Southern Hemisphere. The aim of this work was to determine UV-B effects on amino acids, phenolic composition and aroma compounds of Pinot noir fruit. Sunlight exposure with or without UV-B did not affect fruit production capacity, Â°Brix and total amino acids in the vineyard over the two years. This research reported increased contents of skin anthocyanin and skin total phenolics in berry skins under UV-B. The research showed that there were no changes in C6 compounds. Some monoterpenes concentrations were decreased by UV-B. The information also indicated how important leaf canopy management was for vineyard management. Therefore, UV radiation potentially affected fruit ripeness and crop load, and even stimulated the accumulation of phenolic compounds that may affect Pinot noir quality. This research reported that canopy management (UV-B exposure) may be a good way for vineyard management to increase the accumulation of anthocyanins and tannins in berry skins.",
