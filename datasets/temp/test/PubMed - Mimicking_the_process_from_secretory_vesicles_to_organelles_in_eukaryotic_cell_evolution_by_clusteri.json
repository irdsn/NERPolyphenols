  "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells exhibit complex multicompartmentalized structures that optimize enzymatic efficiency as a result of continuous evolution. Inspired by this, we developed artificial cell models mimicking the evolutionary process from secretory vesicles to organelles using liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). An aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) enabled the creation of membrane-less compartments encapsulating liposomes loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) and myoglobin (Mb). These liposomes were aggregated using tannic acid (TA) and further coated with metal-phenolic networks (MPN) to mimic organelle formation and abnormal mineralization, respectively. Cascade enzymatic reactions demonstrated that clustering enzyme-liposomes significantly enhanced efficiency, facilitating substrate channelling and minimizing diffusional loss, supporting the hypothesis that enzymatic optimization drove the evolution of eukaryotic organelles. Conversely, excessive TA and MPN coatings inhibited enzymatic activity, illustrating the detrimental effects of abnormal mineralization. This study offers a novel perspective on cellular evolution and the fundamental principles of life.",
