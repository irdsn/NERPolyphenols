  "title": "Protective Potential of a Botanical-Based Supplement Ingredient against the Impact of Environmental Pollution on Cutaneous and Cardiopulmonary Systems: Preclinical Study.",
  "abstract": "Air pollution is a growing threat to human health. Airborne pollution effects on respiratory, cardiovascular and skin health are well-established. The main mechanisms of air-pollution-induced health effects involve oxidative stress and inflammation. The present study evaluates the potential of a polyphenol-enriched food supplement ingredient comprisingLippia citriodora,Olea europaea,Rosmarinus officinalis, andSophora japonicaextracts in mitigating the adverse effects of environmental pollution on skin and cardiopulmonary systems. Both in vitro and ex vivo studies were used to assess the blend's effects against pollution-induced damage. In these studies, the botanical blend was found to reduce lipid peroxidation, inflammation (by reducing IL-1Î±), and metabolic alterations (by regulating MT-1H, AhR, and Nrf2 expression) in human skin explants exposed to a mixture of pollutants. Similar results were also observed in keratinocytes exposed to urban dust. Moreover, the ingredient significantly reduced pollutant-induced ROS production in human endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts, while downregulating the expression of apoptotic genes (bcl-2 and bax) in lung fibroblasts. Additionally, the blend counteracted the effect of urban dust on the heart rate in zebrafish embryos. These results support the potential use of this supplement as an adjuvant method to reduce the impact of environmental pollution on the skin, lungs, and cardiovascular tissues.",
