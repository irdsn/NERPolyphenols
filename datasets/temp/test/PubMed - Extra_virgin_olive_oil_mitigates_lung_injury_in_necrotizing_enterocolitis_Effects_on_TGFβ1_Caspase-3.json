  "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NE), which is common in premature babies, has been associated with lung damage. Our aim is to explore the effect of enterally administered extra virgin olive oil (EO) with rich polyphenol content on clinical parameters, histopathological score, Transforming growt factor beta-1 (TGFβ1), Caspase 3 and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in NE-related lung injury of neonatal rats.",
