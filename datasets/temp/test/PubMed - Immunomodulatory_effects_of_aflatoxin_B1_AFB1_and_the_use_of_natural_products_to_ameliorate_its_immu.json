  "title": "Immunomodulatory effects of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the use of natural products to ameliorate its immunotoxic effects: A review.",
  "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1(AFB1), a potent mycotoxin, is known to be an immunotoxic agent that causes various immune system disorders. It can cause immunosuppression by direct toxic effect on the host or by its ability to interfere with the immune response and thereby lead to secondary infections. The immunomodulatory effects of AFB1and its metabolites have been reported in many studies. Yet, the exact mechanisms responsible for these immunomodulatory effects are still obscure. This review summarizes the current findings on the interaction between AFB1and the host immune system, while also highlighting other potential mechanisms involved in AFB1-induced immunosuppression. These potential mechanisms include modulation of cytokine production, production of inflammatory mediators and their receptors, activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, alteration in cell surface receptors involved in T cell activation and regulation of apoptosis. The review also discusses the findings on natural products that have been found capable of inhibiting AFB1-induced immunosuppression in various animal models. With the latest exploration of natural products as a solution, the burden of aflatoxicosis in society is likely to subdue. Some of the promising natural products that have been highlighted to have ameliorative effects include grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), bentonite clay, smectites clay andSpirulina plantesisamong others. Considering the seriousness of aflatoxicosis in the public domain and lack of effective management approaches, there is an urgent need for more research to understand AFB1-induced immunotoxicity and possible remedies.",
