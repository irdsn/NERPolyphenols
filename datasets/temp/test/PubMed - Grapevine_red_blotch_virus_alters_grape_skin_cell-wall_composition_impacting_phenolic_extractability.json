  "abstract": "Grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) is the causal agent of grapevine red blotch disease and is known to delay grape ripening. However, grape cell-wall modifications during GRBV infection are largely unknown, even though the cell wall plays a large role in pathogenicity, viral interactions with host plants, and phenolic extractability during winemaking. Understanding the impact of GRBV infection on cell-wall metabolism is important for the development of potential mitigations strategies. In this study, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing was conducted on Vitis vinifera L. 'Merlot' grapes during ripening. The cell-wall composition, phenolic content, and phenolic extractability at two different commercial harvest points were also determined.",
