  "abstract": "Doxorubicin is an essential cancer treatment, but its usefulness is hampered by the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. Nevertheless, the pathophysiology underlying doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the respective molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested involvement of cellular senescence.",
