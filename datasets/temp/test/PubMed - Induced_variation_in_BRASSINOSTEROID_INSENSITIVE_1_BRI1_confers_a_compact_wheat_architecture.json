  "abstract": "The brassinosteroid (BR) plant hormones regulate numerous developmental processes, including those determining stem height, leaf angle, and grain size that have agronomic relevance in cereals. Indeed, barley (Hordeum vulgare) varieties containing uzu alleles that impair BR perception through mutations in the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) exhibit a semi-dwarf growth habit and more upright leaves suitable for high-density planting. We used forward and reverse genetic approaches to develop novel BRI1 alleles in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and investigated their potential for crop productivity improvement.",
