  "abstract": "The accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) lead to a series of immune responses such as: increased oxidative stress and inflammation which contribute to the development of diabetic complications and periodontal disease. Resveratrol is a natural compound that has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Studies have found that diabetes-induced periodontitis is mainly caused by oxidative stress, aging and increased inflammation. In view of resveratrol has been proposed to have the ability in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation in a variety of tissues. However, the role of resveratrol in diabetic periodontitis remains to be investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of resveratrol in preventing and treating diabetic periodontitis.",
