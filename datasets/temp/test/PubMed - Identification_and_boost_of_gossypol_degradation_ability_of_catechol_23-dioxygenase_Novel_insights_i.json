  "title": "Identification and boost of gossypol degradation ability of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase: Novel insights into resourceful utilization of cottonseed byproducts.",
  "abstract": "Gossypol, a toxic polyphenolic compound in cottonseed byproducts, jeopardizes consumers' health; severely limiting the resourceful utilization of cottonseed byproducts in food and feed industries. Herein, a novel gossypol-degrading enzyme, catechol 2, 3-dioxygenase (CatE_W1), was identified in Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Purified CatE_W1 had optimal activity at 45 °C and pH 9.0, degrading 49 % of free gossypol within 15 min. Mass spectrometry suggested degradation mainly occurs via binaphthalene bond cleavage and naphthalene ring opening. Further risk assessments revealed that CatE_W1's degradation ameliorated gossypol-induced hepatotoxicity and testicular damage. Subsequently, structural confirmation and molecular docking elucidated the mechanism of CatE_W1-gossypol interaction, with alanine scanning confirming residues Y91, P151, and E152 as critical for catalysis. A mutant, A99L/T101W/A148W, with 3.57-fold increased catalytic efficiency and 1.76-fold enhanced thermostability was obtained by virtual saturation mutagenesis. These findings first reveal the gossypol degradation ability and mechanisms of catechol 2, 3-dioxygenase, enabling targeted enzyme development for safer cottonseed byproduct utilization.",
