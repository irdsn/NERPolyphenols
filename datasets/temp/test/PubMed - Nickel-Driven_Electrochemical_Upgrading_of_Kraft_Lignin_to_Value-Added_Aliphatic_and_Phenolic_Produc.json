  "abstract": "The depolymerization of lignin represents a promising strategy for its efficient utilization as a precursor for industrial raw materials. However, achieving both high efficiency and environmental sustainability remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present an aqueous electrochemical approach employing nickel as an electrocatalyst, enabling both depolymerization and partial de-aromatization of Kraft lignin under mild reaction conditions. Using an aqueous sodium carbonate medium, room temperature and ambient pressure, we achieved lignin depolymerization over reaction times ranging from 5 to 20 h. Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of aliphatic products such as acetate and formate, while high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) confirmed the formation of a wide range of phenolic compounds. The conversion of lignin into valuable aromatic and aliphatic compounds offers a promising pathway for the synthesis of a wide range of organic chemicals and their subsequent industrial utilization, thereby supporting the development of a more sustainable economy.",
