  "title": "Resveratrol improved atherosclerosis by increasing LDLR levels via the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.",
  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a complex and chronic vascular disease and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is one of its primary causative factors. As a key surface receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays an essential role in LDL-C clearance. Resveratrol (RSV) has emerged as a promising compound for investigating potential therapeutic targets for AS due to its ability to lower cholesterol, reduce endothelial anti-inflammatory and suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. This study explored the effects of RSV on AS through upregulating LDLR and analyzed the mechanism through a combination of in vivo and vitro experiments.",
