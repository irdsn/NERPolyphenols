  "abstract": "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in patients on tamoxifen therapy is a rare but potentially serious complication. This patient underwent a laparoscopic unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to persistent pelvic pain and received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist injection with normalisation of her oestradiol level, previously elevated to 956 pg/mL. Management options of OHSS include medical therapy with GnRH agonists or surgical intervention. Studies have shown that GnRH agonists can effectively normalise oestradiol levels and induce the resolution of cysts in these patients. Additionally, combined therapy with tamoxifen and GnRH agonists may reduce the risk of OHSS. Risk factors for OHSS during tamoxifen treatment include younger age and absence of chemotherapy. Monitoring of oestradiol levels and close clinical follow-up are essential in managing patients on tamoxifen therapy to prevent and promptly address OHSS.",
