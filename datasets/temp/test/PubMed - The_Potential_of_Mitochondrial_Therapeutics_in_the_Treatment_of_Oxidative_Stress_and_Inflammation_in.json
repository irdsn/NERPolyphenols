  "title": "The Potential of Mitochondrial Therapeutics in the Treatment of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Aging.",
  "abstract": "Mitochondria are central to cellular energy production, and their dysfunction is a major contributor to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, pivotal factors in aging, and related diseases. With aging, mitochondrial efficiency declines, leading to an increase in ROS and persistent inflammatory responses. Therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial health show promise in mitigating these detrimental effects. Antioxidants such as MitoQ and MitoVitE, and supplements like coenzyme Q10 and NAD + precursors, have demonstrated potential in reducing oxidative stress. Additionally, gene therapy aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function, alongside lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and caloric restriction can ameliorate age-related mitochondrial decline. Exercise not only boosts mitochondrial biogenesis but also improves mitophagy. Enhancing mitophagy is a key strategy to prevent the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and longevity. Pharmacological agents like sulforaphane, SS-31, and resveratrol indirectly promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improve cellular resistance to oxidative damage. The exploration of mitochondrial therapeutics, including emerging techniques like mitochondrial transplantation, offers significant avenues for extending health span and combating age-related diseases. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires overcoming challenges in precisely targeting dysfunctional mitochondria and optimizing delivery mechanisms for therapeutic agents. Continued research is essential to refine these approaches and fully understand the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and aging.",
