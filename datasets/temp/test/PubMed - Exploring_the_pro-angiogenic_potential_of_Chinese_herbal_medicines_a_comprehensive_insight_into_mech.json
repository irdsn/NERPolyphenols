  "title": "Exploring the pro-angiogenic potential of Chinese herbal medicines: a comprehensive insight into mechanisms.",
  "abstract": "Pro-angiogenic therapy aims to stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, thereby enhancing blood flow to tissues and organs. Current strategies, such as growth factors, gene therapy, and cell-based approaches, are widely employed to promote angiogenesis. However, these interventions often suffer from off-target effects and limited efficacy due to the complex regulation of angiogenesis. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) provides a rich source of therapeutic agents and offers promising alternatives for the treatment of vascular insufficiency-related disorders.",
