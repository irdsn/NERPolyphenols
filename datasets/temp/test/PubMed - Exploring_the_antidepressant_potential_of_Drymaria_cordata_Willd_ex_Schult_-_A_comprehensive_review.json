Drymaria cordata Willd. ex Schult (D. cordata) is a medicinal herb traditionally used in folk medicine to treat various ailments, including headaches, convulsions, bronchitis, and ocular disorders. It has also demonstrated several central nervous system (CNS)-related activities, such as anxiolytic, analgesic, anti-nociceptive, antitussive, and anti-amnesic effects.
