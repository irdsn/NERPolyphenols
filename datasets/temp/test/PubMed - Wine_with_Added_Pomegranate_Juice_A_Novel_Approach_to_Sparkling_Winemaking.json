  "abstract": "This study investigates the incorporation of pomegranate juice into the fermentation process to produce a novel ros√© sparkling wine with enhanced antioxidant properties and improved acidity while preserving desirable sensory qualities. Initial trials blended a Glera base wine with 5%, 10%, and 15% pomegranate juice, followed by bottle fermentation to select the optimal formulation. The 10% blend, identified as the best, underwent a second fermentation in an autoclave using the Martinotti method. Chemical analyses were conducted to assess polyphenol content, protein stability, antioxidant activity, and colour, while sensory evaluations determined the flavour balance and acceptability. Results demonstrated that pomegranate juice significantly increased polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. The 10% blend achieved balanced acidity, sweetness, and carbonation, with pronounced fruity and floral aromas. However, protein stability tests revealed haze formation, emphasizing the need for stabilization refinements. This study highlights the feasibility of integrating pomegranate juice into sparkling wine production. It explores alternative and innovative uses for pomegranate to maximize its potential beyond traditional applications, leverages its unique properties, such as high antioxidant content, to enhance value-added products, and demonstrates its potential to diversify the portfolio of fruit wines while appealing to modern consumer preferences.",
