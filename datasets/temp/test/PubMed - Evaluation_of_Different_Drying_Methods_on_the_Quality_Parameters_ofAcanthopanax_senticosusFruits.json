  "abstract": "Acanthopanax senticosus(Rupr. and Maxim.; AS) fruit, an underutilized byproduct, possesses significant bioactive potential, yet its quality is highly influenced by drying methods. This study systematically evaluated the effects of five drying techniques, including vacuum freeze-drying (VFD), vacuum drying (VD), microwave drying (MD), hot-air drying (HD), and natural drying (ND), on the color retention, bioactive composition, volatile profile, and antioxidant activity of AS fruit. VFD preserved the highest levels of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC), particularly chlorogenic acid, rutin, and quercitrin, leading to superior antioxidant activity. Amino acid analysis indicated that VFD retained the highest concentrations of key essential amino acids, minimizing thermal degradation. Correlation analysis revealed a strong association between TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activity, emphasizing their functional significance. Through multivariate statistical analysis, 12 volatile compounds were identified as potential biomarkers to distinguish AS fruit samples processed using different drying methods, highlighting significant metabolic differences between drying techniques. Overall, VFD emerged as the optimal method for preserving AS fruit's bioactive integrity, offering valuable insights for post-harvest processing strategies in the nutraceutical industry.",
