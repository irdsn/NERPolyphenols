  "abstract": "This study investigated the microencapsulation of phenolic compounds from grape pomace extract (GPE) obtained from Sonora, Mexico, with maltodextrin and gum arabic through spray-drying for application in Greek-style yogurt. The microencapsulated GPE (MGPE) showed high encapsulation efficiency 97.82 % and average particle size (3.48 μm) below of sensory perception. The main identified phenolic compounds were gallic acid, quercetin, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidins. During a 90-day shelf-life assay, the MGPE was stable, while GPE decreased in total phenolic content (TPC), monomeric anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity. Incorporation of MGPE into the Greek-style yogurt significantly improved the antioxidant activity determined by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, MGPE added in yogurt preserved phenolic compounds stability and increased its bioaccessibility at the intestinal phase. These suggest maltodextrin and gum arabic are an effective vehicle to deliver the antioxidant compounds from grape pomace through Greek-style yogurt and improve health.",
