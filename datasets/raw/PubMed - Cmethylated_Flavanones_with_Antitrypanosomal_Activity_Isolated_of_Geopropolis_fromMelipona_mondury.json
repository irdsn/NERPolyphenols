  "abstract": "Geopropolis is a natural antibiotic produced by stingless bees, supplemented with earth and clay. Bee products are a promising source of natural bioactive compounds with potential for the development of new drugs for neglected tropical diseases, such as Chagas disease. This study analyzed extracts ofMelipona mondurygeopropolis from the Bosque da Barra da Tijuca (RJ, Brazil) and evaluated their activity againstTrypanosoma cruzi. The extracts were obtained using commercial grain alcohol 96° GL and fractionated with hexane and dichloromethane. The antichagasic activity was determined, with IC50values ranging from 4.54 to 53.02 μg/mL. Phytochemical investigation of the dichloromethane fraction resulted in the isolation of twoC-methylated flavanones, (2S)-strobopinin and (2S)-cryptostrobin, which were identified for the first time in Brazilian geopropolis. These compounds showed IC50values of 21.21 μM and 21.55 μM, respectively, with distinct cytotoxities: 33.80 μM for strobopinin and 99.79 μM for cryptostrobin. Molecular modeling studies were conducted to propose a mechanism of action on a candidate enzyme target, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and possible reasons for the selectivity differences caused byC-methylation. The results highlightM. mondurygeopropolis as a promising natural source of antiparasitic agents, supporting its potential for drug development.",
