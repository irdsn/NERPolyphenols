  "title": "Molecular Perspective of Dietary Influences on the Gut Microbiome alongside Neurological Health: Exploring the Gut-Brain Axis.",
  "abstract": "Gut-brain axis, an intricate, two-way communication network between gut microorganisms and the central nervous system, plays a critical role in controlling brain function and thereby influencing mental health. Changes to this axis, frequently due to shifts in gut microbiota, can greatly affect brain function by hindering the creation of essential metabolites. This review examines new nutritional trends, including fermented foods and diets rich in prebiotics, that demonstrate the potential to improve microbial diversity and metabolic well-being. Although current studies emphasize possible advantages, most concentrate mainly on older populations, leaving research in younger groups limited. The field of nutritional psychiatry encounters difficulties due to the diversity in research methodologies and the intricacies of nutrient balance, potentially hindering prompt interventions. This review highlights the necessity for prolonged research to evaluate the effects of eating habits, especially regarding Western dietary patterns. Promising fields include the influence of the Mediterranean diet, the role of symbiotic and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the importance of high-fiber foods, polyphenols, and fruits and vegetables in enhancing mental health through gut-derived metabolites. We promote interdisciplinary methods that combine nutrition science, microbiology, and neurology to create tailored dietary recommendations focused on enhancing brain health.",
