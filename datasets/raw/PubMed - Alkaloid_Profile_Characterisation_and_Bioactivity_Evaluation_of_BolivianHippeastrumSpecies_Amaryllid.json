  "abstract": "Amaryllidaceae alkaloids from the Amaryllidoideae subfamily exhibit broad pharmacological activities, including neuroprotection and anticancer effects. Galanthamine is a key compound for Alzheimer's therapy. TheHippeastrumgenus, particularly in Bolivia, offers significant potential for novel drug discovery, emphasising the need for conservation and further phytochemical research. Twenty-seven samples from BolivianHippeastrumspecies were investigated in terms of their alkaloid profile and anticholinesterase activity. The phytochemical analysis of BolivianHippeastrumspecies via GC-MS identified 48 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, displaying diverse structural groups with potential pharmacological significance. Lycorine- and Homolycorine-type alkaloids were predominant, particularly inH. chionedyanthumandH. haywardii, with high concentrations of lycorine, a promising anticancer compound. The speciesH. evansiarumandH. mollevillquensecontained notable quantities of Galanthamine type alkaloids, relevant for Alzheimer's treatment. This study also highlights variability in acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities, withH. lara-ricoiandH. haywardiidemonstrating strong inhibition. These findings suggest thatHippeastrumspecies are a valuable source of bioactive compounds, warranting further research into their therapeutic applications.",
