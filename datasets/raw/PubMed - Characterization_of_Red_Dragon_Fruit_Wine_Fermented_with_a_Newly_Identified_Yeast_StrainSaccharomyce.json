  "abstract": "Dragon fruit (Hylocereusspp.) has been known to be a rich source of bioactive compounds, such as anthocyanins, betacyanin, betaxanthin and other phenolic substances, and it has a nutritional profile suitable to produce wine with functional properties. The aim of this study is to characterize the wine fermentation from red dragon fruit juice by a newly identified yeast strain.",
