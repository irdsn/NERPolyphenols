  "abstract": "Flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is generally thought unique to land plants and has assisted plants to adapt the terrestrial ecosystems. In this pathway, four 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs), i.e., flavone synthase I (FNSI), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and anthocyanin synthase/leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (ANS/LDOX), catalyze the hydroxylation and desaturation reactions. In bryophytes, the earliest land plant group, little is known about the biological functions of these enzymes.",
