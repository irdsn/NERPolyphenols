  "abstract": "Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is an oscillatory rise in blood flow to glabrous skin that occurs in cold-exposed extremities. Dietary flavanols increase bioavailable nitric oxide, a proposed mediator of CIVD through active vasodilation and/or withdrawal of sympathetic vascular smooth muscle tone. However, no studies have examined the effects of flavanol intake on extremity skin perfusion during cold exposure. We tested the hypothesis that acute and 8-day flavanol supplementation would augment CIVD during single-digit cold water immersion (CWI).",
