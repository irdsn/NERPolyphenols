  "abstract": "Here we present a study of the characterization and optimization of the production of trans-Resveratrol (t-R) in grape (Vitis viniferacv. Gamay) cell cultures elicited with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin (DIMEB). The aim of this study was to determine the influence of a number of factors of the grapevine cell culture ont-R production level in 250 mL shaken flasks that would enable the better control of this bioproduction system when it is upscaled to a 2 L stirred bioreactor. The factors included the optimal growth phase for elicitation, the concentration of elicitors and of biomass, the order of addition of elicitors, and the illumination regime and ageing of cells. We found out that the optimal biomass density for the production oft-R was 19% (w/v) with an optimal ratio of 0.5 g DIMEB/g biomass. The most productive concentrations of the elicitors tested were 50 mM DIMEB and 100 µM MeJA, reaching maximum values of 4.18 mg·mL-1and 16.3 mg·g biomass-1oft-R concentration and specific production, respectively. We found that the order of elicitor addition matters since, as compared with the simultaneous addition of both elicitors, the addition of MeJA 48 h before DIMEB results in ca. 40% lesst-R production, whilst there is no significant difference when MeJA is added 48 h after DIMEB. Upon upscaling, the better conditions tested fort-R production were aeration at 1.7 vol/vol/min without agitation, 24 °C, and 30 g·L-1sucrose, achieving production rates similar to those obtained in shaken flasks.",
