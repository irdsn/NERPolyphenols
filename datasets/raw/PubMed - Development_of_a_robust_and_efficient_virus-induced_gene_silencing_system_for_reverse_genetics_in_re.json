  "abstract": "Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a rapid and powerful method for gene functional analysis in plants that pose challenges in stable transformation. Numerous VIGS systems based on Agrobacterium infiltration has been widely developed for tender tissues of various plant species, yet none is available for recalcitrant perennial woody plants with firmly lignified capsules, such as tea oil camellia. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an efficient, robust, and cost-effective VIGS system for recalcitrant tissues.",
