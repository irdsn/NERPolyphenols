  "abstract": "Methane emissions from ruminants represent a major contributor to global greenhouse gases (GHGs), posing challenges for sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation. Recent advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas)-based gene editing offer transformative approaches to address this issue by targeting both forage crops and rumen methanogens. Enhancing lipid content and secondary metabolites in forage crops can suppress methanogenesis and improve feed efficiency, while precise genome editing in methanogenic Archaea can disrupt pathways critical to methane production. However, challenges remain regarding delivery methods, gene targeting specificity, ecological impacts, and regulatory acceptance. In this review, we explore current progress, identify key knowledge gaps, and highlight the need for interdisciplinary strategies that integrate biotechnology, synthetic biology, and regulatory frameworks to develop effective and scalable methane mitigation solutions.",
