  "abstract": "Osteoclastic bone resorption markedly increases with aging, leading to osteoporosis characterized by weak and fragile bones. Mice exhibit greater bone resorption and poor bone mass when Sirt1 is removed from their osteoclasts. Here we investigated theex vivoimpacts of putative Sirt1 activators, Resveratrol (RSV), SRT2183, and SRT1720, on osteoclast formation and activity in primary mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) derived from wild-type (WT) and osteoclast specific Sirt1 knockout (OC-Sirt1KO) mice and in the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line.",
