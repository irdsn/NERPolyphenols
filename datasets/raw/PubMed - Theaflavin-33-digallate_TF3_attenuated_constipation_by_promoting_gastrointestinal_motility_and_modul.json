  "abstract": "TF3 is a functional pigment formed during the process of black tea. This study aims to explore the anti-constipation effects of TF3 and compare its efficacy with the anti-constipation drug mosapride. Result showed that both TF3 and mosapride increased fecal water content and promoted gastrointestinal (GI) motility, but TF3 was more effective in restoring excitatory neurotransmitters like gastrin (Gas), motilin (MTL), and substance P (SP). TF3 uniquely altered the gut microbiota profile and restored the bacterial community at the phylum level. TF3 targeted specific bacteria such as Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides, while mosapride affected different bacterial groups. Significant changes in Bacteroides and Prevotellaceae UCG-001 were linked to constipation improvement. Importantly, TF3 did not synergize with mosapride in alleviating constipation. These findings highlight TF3's unique role in modulating gut microbiota to relieve constipation and suggest great potential to develop functional foods with anti-constipation properties using tea-derived polyphenols.",
