  "title": "Inhibition mechanism of thermally induced furfural in simplified sugarcane juice model system by polyphenols.",
  "abstract": "The inhibitory mechanisms of 5 polyphenols including vanillin (V), chlorogenic acid (CA), hydroxybenzoic acid (HA), 3, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P) and gallic acid (GA) on furfural (FF) in sugarcane juice model systems were investigated in this study. The inhibition rates of all these 5 polyphenols on the FF could reach over 90Â %. The contents of Fru and 3-DG in polyphenol system were lower than those in Fru/Ser. The adducts formed from polyphenols and Fru were found in all systems and exhibited a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. The results of correlation analysis indicated CA, HA and P exerted negative effects on of FF. Polyphenols probably inhibited FF generation by 2 ways: competitive binding with the precursors and preventing the conversion of intermediates to FF by scavenging free radicals. These results provided basis for improving the quality and safety of sugarcane juice and the application of polyphenol in food industry.",
