  "title": "Gram-Scale Synthesis of a Laccase-Like Cu36Nanocluster with Enhanced Catalytic Activity and Stability.",
  "abstract": "The widespread development of natural laccase in applications is limited by its sensitivity to environmental conditions and high production costs. We report an atomically precise Cu36nanoclusterzyme that is composed of a Cu22core stabilized by seven Cu2L(L: 2-(2-(diphenylphosphaneyl)phenethyl)quinoline) staple units, three adamantanethiol (S-Adm) ligands, and one acetate ion (CH3COO-). This Cu36nanoclusterzyme demonstrates a laccase-like activity and exhibits dual functionality: (1) it catalyzes oxidation of phenolic pollutants with a maximum rate (4.12 μM·min-1), which is 2.8 times greater than that of natural laccase and (2) it enables selective detection of epinephrine through a colorimetric response, with a detection limit of 0.43 μg/mL. Importantly, the Cu36nanoclusterzyme is stable under extreme conditions, including extreme pH values, ionic strength, temperature, and storage time. It also preserves 80% catalytic efficiency after seven cycles and exhibits broad substrate specificity. These results demonstrate the application potential of the efficient Cu36nanoclusterzyme in the fields of analytical chemistry, environmental protection, and biotechnology.",
