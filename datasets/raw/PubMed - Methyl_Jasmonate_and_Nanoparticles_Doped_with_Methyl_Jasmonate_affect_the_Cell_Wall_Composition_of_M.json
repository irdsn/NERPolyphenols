  "abstract": "The structural composition of the cell wall of grape skins is related to the cell wall integrity and subsequent extraction of the different compounds that are contained inside vacuoles and also the cell wall breakdown products. Different reports have established that methyl jasmonate (MeJ) produces changes in the composition of the grape skin cell wall. The use of elicitors to promote the production of secondary metabolites in grapes has been studied in several reports; however, its study linked to nanotechnology is less developed. These facts led us to study the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and nanoparticles doped with MeJ (nano-MeJ) on the cell walls of Monastrell grapes during three seasons. Both treatments tended to increase cell wall material (CWM) and caused changes in different components of the skin cell walls. In 2019 and 2021, proteins were enlarged in both MeJ and nano-MeJ-treated grapes. A general decrease in total phenolic compounds was detected with both treatments, in addition to an increment in uronic acids when the grapes were well ripened. MeJ and nano-MeJ produced a diminution in the amount of cellulose in contrast to an increase in hemicellulose. It should be noted that the effects with nano-MeJ treatment occurred at a dose 10 times lower than with MeJ treatment.",
