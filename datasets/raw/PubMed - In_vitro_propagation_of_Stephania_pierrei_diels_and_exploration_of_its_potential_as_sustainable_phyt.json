  "abstract": "The tuber of Stephania pierrei Diels has been used for treating cardiovascular disease, migraine, and body edema and may exhibit antimalarial, anticancer, and anticholinesterase properties. It is also a popular ornamental plant. Consequently, plant tubers have been extensively harvested from the wild, posing a high risk of extinction. We assessed the in vitro propagation and essential phytochemical production from the calli of S. pierrei.",
