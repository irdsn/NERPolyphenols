  "abstract": "Domestic cats are susceptible to obesity and chronic renal failure, leading to significant health risks. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene (NAG-1), also known as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), is a member of the transforming growth factor-Î² superfamily and has been associated with anti-obesity properties and preservation of kidney function. While the NAG-1 sequence has been extensively studied in several species, a comprehensive understanding of feline NAG-1 remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the nucleotide sequence of feline NAG-1 and its biological role in kidney protection through in-vitro experiments.",
