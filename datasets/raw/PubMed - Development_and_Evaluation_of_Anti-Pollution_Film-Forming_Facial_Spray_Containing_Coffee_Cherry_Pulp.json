  "abstract": "Background/Objectives: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an anti-pollution film-forming spray (FFS) containing coffee cherry pulp extract (FFS-CCS). The formulation was designed to create a protective skin barrier, improving skin health while defending against environmental pollutants. Its physical properties, dust resistance, stability, skin penetration, and clinical effectiveness were assessed to ensure optimal performance and safety.Methods: Various polymers and a ternary solvent system were used to enhance the stability and solubility of bioactive compounds from the coffee cherry pulp extract. The formulations were characterized based on appearance, film formation, viscosity, pH, spray uniformity, spray pattern, angle, film thickness, and particle adhesion. Stability testing was conducted under different storage conditions. Skin penetration was assessed using Franz diffusion cells with Strat-MÂ®membranes to simulate human skin. A single-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants was conducted over 60 days to evaluate the effects of FFS-CCS on skin hydration, tone, and wrinkle reduction. Clinical assessments were performed using a Corneometer, Mexameter, and Skin Visioscan.Results: The FFS1-CCS formulation, incorporating PVP K90 and a ternary solvent system, significantly improved the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of key bioactive compounds (chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and theophylline). Physical characterization confirmed uniform, transparent films with optimal viscosity and sprayability. Stability testing showed minimal degradation. Skin penetration and retention studies revealed enhanced retention of bioactive compounds with minimal systemic absorption. PVP K90, along with ethanol and propylene glycol, extended the compounds' residence time on the skin, ensuring localized delivery. Clinically, FFS1-CCS significantly improved skin hydration, reduced roughness, lightened skin tone, and decreased erythema.Conclusions: The FFS1-CCS formulation utilizing PVP K90 significantly enhanced the stability, bioavailability, and skin retention of coffee cherry pulp extract, resulting in improved skin hydration, wrinkle reduction, and skin tone enhancement. These findings highlight the potential of coffee cherry pulp extract as a multifunctional, sustainable cosmeceutical ingredient, offering both anti-aging and environmental protection benefits, making it a promising solution for skincare applications.",
