  "abstract": "There is growing interest in quantifying phenolic bioactives (PBs) in food matrices, including a variety of nutritious flours. The objective of this study apply a factorial design to determine the total (TT) and bioaccessible (TB) levels of PBs in 26 nutritious flours, using the INFOGEST in vitro digestion method. Acids (gallic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, sinapic and ellagic) and flavonoids (catechin, rutin, quercetin and kaempferol) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). TT ranged, in μg g-1, from 3.16 ± 0.27 (p-coumaric acid) to 3803 ± 217 (rutin). TB, in μg g-1, ranged from <0.17 to 1.37 ± 0.07 (ellagic acid) to <0.16 to 88.83 ± 0.72 (catechin). Significant concentrations of CP in nutritious flours - eggplant (FBJ), orange (FLJ) and grape seed (FSU) - are relevant to profile these samples and help consumers incorporate them into their daily diets.",
