  "abstract": "Hyperglycaemia-induced protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) has been suggested to be linked with vascular complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we investigated if 7,4'-dimethoxy-3-hydroxyflavone (DMF-OH), a flavonoid-derived PAR4 antagonist, can ameliorate hyperglycaemia-associated endothelial dysfunction, which is a key early event in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy.",
