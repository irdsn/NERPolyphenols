  "title": "Novel approach for development and optimization of microgreens-based functional dairy beverage: Antioxidant enhancement, consumer acceptability, and kinetic shelf-life modeling.",
  "abstract": "This study optimizes a microgreens-based dairy (lassi) beverage using response surface methodology to enhance antioxidant composition, sensory attributes, and shelf stability. The ideal formulation (9.189 % microgreen juice, 60 % dahi, and 15.311 % water) achieved a desirability score of 0.781, significantly improving bioactive compounds. The optimized lassi contained phenolics (44.14 mg GAE/100 g), flavonoids (22.62 mg QUE/100 g), anthocyanins (37.91 μmol/100 g), and ascorbic acid (59.32 mg/100 g), with an acceptability rating of 8.29. Kinetic modeling assessed bioactive stability under varying storage conditions, with the highest retention at 5 °C after 15-days. Temperature-dependent degradation rates were analyzed using the Arrhenius, Eyring, and Ball models, while shelf-life prediction was based on a zero-order reaction model combined with the Arrhenius equation. The estimated shelf life at 5 °C based on microbial load was 9.33 days (t1/2), with production cost, aligning with market trends. These findings highlight commercial potential of radish sango microgreens in developing a nutritious, antioxidant-rich lassi beverage.",
