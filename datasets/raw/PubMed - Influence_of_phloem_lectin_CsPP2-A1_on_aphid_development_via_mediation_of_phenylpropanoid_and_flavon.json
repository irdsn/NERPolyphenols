  "abstract": "Aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, is a pest that significantly affects cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L.). Phloem protein 2 (PP2) is a conserved phloem lectin. Our previous study showed that the expression of CsPP2-A1 under aphid attack affected the accumulation of flavonoids and total phenolics in cucumber. The novel mechanism of lectin CsPP2-A1 mediating secondary metabolites affecting aphid resistance in cucumbers needs to be investigated.",
