  "abstract": "The winemaking industry increasingly relies on non-destructive techniques to support processing activities, particularly in response to climate change-induced imbalances between technological and phenolic grape maturity. Spectroscopy-based instruments have become widely available for monitoring key parameters such as total polyphenols, anthocyanins and tannins during maceration and fermentation. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy presents a promising solution for rapid and efficient analysis, potentially enhancing process control and decision-making in winemaking.",
