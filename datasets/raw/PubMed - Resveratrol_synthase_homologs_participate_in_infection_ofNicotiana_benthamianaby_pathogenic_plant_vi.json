  "abstract": "Resveratrol synthase (RS) is a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of stilbene and resveratrol. Resveratrol has many biological pharmacological activities that are beneficial to human health including anti-cancer, cardiovascular protection, estrogen regulation, antibacterial, antiviral, and reduction of tissue and organ damage. In plants, RS catalyzes the production of resveratrol, which helps to protect against fungal and bacterial diseases.",
