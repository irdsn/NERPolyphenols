  "abstract": "Extractions of the underground parts of valerian were prepared with water and ethanol (25-95%) at 25-75 °C. Extraction yields, bioactive compounds, and the 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability of lyophilized extracts were determined. The inhibitory effects of the extracts, valerenic acid derivatives and phenolic acids, on metabolic syndrome (MS)-related enzymes activities were further examined. Both roots and rhizomes extracted with 95% ethanol at 75 °C had the highest levels of bioactive compounds. The antioxidant capacity and inhibition of MS-related enzymes of the roots extract were better than those of the rhizomes. The roots extract more strongly inhibited pancreatic lipase (inhibition of 50% of enzyme activity (IC50), 17.59 mg/mL), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, IC50, 3.75 mg/mL), α-amylase (IC50, 12.53 mg/mL), and α-glucosidase (IC50, 15.40 mg/mL). These four phenolic acids inhibited the activity of MS-related enzymes. Valerenic acid demonstrated more of an inhibitory ability for ACE (IC50, 0.225 mg/mL, except for caffeic acid) and α-glucosidase (IC50, 0.617 mg/mL) than phenolic acids. Valerian extract inhibited key enzyme activities that were associated with obesity (lipase), hypertension (ACE), and type 2 diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), suggesting that it is a potential candidate for the development of functional supplements.",
