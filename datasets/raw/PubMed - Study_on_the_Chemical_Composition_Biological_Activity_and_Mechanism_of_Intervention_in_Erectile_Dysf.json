  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical composition, biological activity, and intervention mechanism of Healthy Snow Lotus Wine in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). A preliminary relative characterization and relative quantification of Healthy Snow Lotus Wine was conducted using ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS). This analysis led to the screening of chemical components that met the criteria of drug similarity and bioavailability. Network pharmacology methods were utilized to identify the active ingredients and their molecular targets of Healthy Snow Lotus Wine that are relevant to the treatment of ED. Enrichment analysis revealed a significant association between Healthy Snow Lotus Wine and pathways related to chemical stress, particularly those involved in cellular basement membrane and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex signaling. Molecular docking experiments demonstrated that the key compounds bind well to key ED-related proteins, including STAT3, EGFR, SRC, AKT1, and BCL2. Antioxidant experiments demonstrated that the wine exhibited high antioxidant capacity, with its total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total proanthocyanidin content (TAC) being superior to those of other samples. These findings provide substantial evidence to support the therapeutic potential of Healthy Snow Lotus Wine in treating ED through multiple mechanisms, underscoring its notable biological activity.",
