  "abstract": "Salt stress represents a critical challenge in viticulture, significantly impacting grape berry biochemical profiles and potentially threatening crop productivity and quality. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the metabolic responses of grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. 'Öküzgözü') to salinity stress by applying NaCl at four different concentrations (0, 50, 100, and 150 mM) and shikonin at two levels (0 and 25 µM). Our study analyzed changes in organic acids, phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, and sugar contents, employing a standardized foliar spray technique to explore the individual and interactive effects of salt stress and shikonin on grape berry biochemical composition.",
