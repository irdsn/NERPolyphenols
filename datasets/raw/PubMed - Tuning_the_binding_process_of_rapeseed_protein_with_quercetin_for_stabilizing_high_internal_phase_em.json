  "title": "Tuning the binding process of rapeseed protein with quercetin for stabilizing high internal phase emulsions.",
  "abstract": "Regulation in protein-polyphenols interaction contributes to their application in emulsion, but relative information is very limited. Therefore, this work designed a novel strategy to regulate the interaction of rapeseed protein (RP) with quercetin (Que) for stabilizing high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) loaded with vitamin D3 (VD3). The results showed that whey protein enhanced the interaction of RP with water molecular, and zein contributed to its binding with Que. Modified RP-Que complex possessed higher Que-binding rate (76.15 % vs 96.86 %), DPPH· scavenging rate (45.33 % vs 74.89 %), surface charge (-24 mV), orderliness as well as smaller size (200 nm). Above improvements increased its diffusion rate (0.74 mN/m/s1/2), modulus and adsorption content (350 %) on the oil-water interface, which formed denser network structure in HIPEs, and gave them higher bioavailability and stability of VD3and storage stability of 3D-printing products. Overall, molecular regulation improved the application potential of RP-Que complex in HIPEs.",
