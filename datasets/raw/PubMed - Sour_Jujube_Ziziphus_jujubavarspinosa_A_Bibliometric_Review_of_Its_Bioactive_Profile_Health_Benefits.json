  "abstract": "Research on the comprehensive utilization of sour jujube and its beneficial properties to human health has attracted extensive attention. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the bioactive profile of sour jujube and future trends in applications. The research advancements within this field from 2000 to 2023 were addressed using the Web of Science database and VOSviewer. Among the 322 results, the most frequent keywords of bioactivity are flavonoids, antioxidants, saponins, insomnia, polyphenols, terpenoids and anti-inflammatory; the most studied parts of sour jujube are seeds, fruits and leaves; the published articles with high citations mainly focus on identification, biological effects and different parts distribution of bioactive compounds. The bioactivity of various parts of sour jujube was reviewed considering their application potential. The seeds, rich in flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids, exhibit strong effects on central nervous system diseases and have been well-developed in pharmacology, healthcare products and functional foods. The pulp has antioxidant properties and is used to develop added-value foods (e.g., juice, vinegar, wine). The leaves can be used to make tea and flowers are good sources of honey; their extracts are rich sources of flavonoids and saponins, which show promising medicinal effects. The branches, roots and bark have healing properties in traditional folk medicine. Overall, this study provides a reference for future applications of sour jujube in food and medicine fields.",
