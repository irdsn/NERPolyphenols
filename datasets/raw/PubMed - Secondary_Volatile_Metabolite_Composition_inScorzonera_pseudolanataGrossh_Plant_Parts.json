  "abstract": "Scorzoneraspecies exhibit various biological activities largely dependent on their chemical composition. While numerous studies have investigated these species' secondary volatile metabolite content, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study focused onScorzonera pseudolanata. The present study aimed to identify and analyze the secondary volatile metabolites in different parts ofS.pseudolanata. The composition of these metabolites was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The resulting data were further analyzed through biplot analysis to differentiate among the plant parts. A total of 46 secondary volatile compounds were identified across all examined tissues. Hexadecane (13.6%) was the dominant compound in the roots, phytone (16.36%) in the leaves, and nonadecane (56.45%) in the seeds. The secondary volatile metabolite profile ofS.pseudolanatadiffers markedly from that of otherScorzoneraspecies, a distinction effectively visualized using a biplot diagram. This study represents the first detailed investigation into the secondary volatile metabolite composition ofS.pseudolanata. It offers foundational data that may inform future in-depth research, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of the phytochemistry of this species.",
