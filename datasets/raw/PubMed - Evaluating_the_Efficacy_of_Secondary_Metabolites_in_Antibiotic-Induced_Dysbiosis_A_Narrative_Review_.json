  "abstract": "Drug-induced dysbiosis, particularly from antibiotics, has emerged as a significant contributor to chronic diseases by disrupting gut microbiota composition and function. Plant-derived secondary metabolites, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, alkaloids, and saponins, show potential in mitigating antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. This review aims to consolidate evidence from preclinical studies on the therapeutic effects of secondary metabolites in restoring gut microbial balance, emphasizing their mechanisms and efficacy.",
