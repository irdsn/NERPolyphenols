  "abstract": "Methane mitigation is regarded as a critical strategy to combat the scale of global warming. Currently, ~40% of methane emissions originate from microbial sources, which is causing strategies to suppress methanogens-either through direct toxic effects or by diverting their substrates and energy-to gain traction. Problematically, current microbial methane mitigation knowledge lacks detailed microbiome-centered insights, limiting translation across conditions and ecosystems. Here we utilize genome-resolved metatranscriptomes and metabolomes to assess the impact of a proposed methane inhibitor, catechin, on greenhouse gas emissions for high-methane-emitting peatlands. In microcosms, catechin drastically reduced methane emissions by 72%-84% compared to controls. Longitudinal sampling allowed for reconstruction of a catechin degradation pathway involving Actinomycetota and Clostridium, which break down catechin into smaller phenolic compounds within the first 21Â days, followed by degradation of phenolic compounds by Pseudomonas_E from Days 21 to 35. These genomes co-expressed hydrogen-uptake genes, suggesting hydrogenases may act as a hydrogen sink during catechin degradation and consequently reduce hydrogen availability to methanogens. In support of this idea, there was decreased gene expression by hydrogenotrophic and hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogens under catechin treatment. There was also reduced gene expression from genomes inferred to be functioning syntrophically with hydrogen-utilizing methanogens. We propose that catechin metabolic redirection effectively starves hydrogen-utilizing methanogens, offering a potent avenue for curbing methane emissions across diverse environments including ruminants, landfills, and constructed or managed wetlands.",
