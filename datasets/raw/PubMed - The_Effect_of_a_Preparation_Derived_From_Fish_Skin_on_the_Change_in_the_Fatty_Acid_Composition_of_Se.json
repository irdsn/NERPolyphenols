  "title": "The Effect of a Preparation Derived From Fish Skin on the Change in the Fatty Acid Composition of Sebum in Individuals With Demodicosis.",
  "abstract": "Fatty acid (FA) metabolism is associated with Demodicosis, an increasingly common skin condition frequently observed in adolescents and adults, but it is not yet well defined whether the distribution or location of FAs in facial sebum differs according to the disease. In a study with a group of 50 patients diagnosed with Demodicosis and 40 control subjects, sebum samples were collected from the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas using Sebutape patches. Total FAs were analyzed using gas chromatography. The patients with Demodex were divided into two groups. Twenty-five individuals used only the placebo cosmetic base, while the other 25 applied the target product. The extraction of key active ingredients aligns with the trend of sustainable cosmetic production and upcycling. Compared to healthy women, the female patients showed higher levels of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) from both facial areas, while lower levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were observed in the chin area samples. Patients with Demodicosis exhibited more pronounced abnormalities in sebum and specific FA profiles in the chin area, consistent with the higher incidence of Demodicosis in adult women, particularly in these facial areas. The differential distribution of FAs in facial sebum and its correlation with the occurrence of Demodicosis led to the application of innovative upcycling ingredients. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the difference in the FA profile between individuals with and without Demodicosis.",
