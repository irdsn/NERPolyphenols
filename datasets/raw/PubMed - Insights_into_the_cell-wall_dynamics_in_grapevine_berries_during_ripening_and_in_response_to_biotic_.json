  "abstract": "The cell wall (CW) is the dynamic structure of a plant cell, acting as a barrier against biotic and abiotic stresses. In grape berries, the modifications of pulp and skin CW during softening ensure flexibility during cell expansion and determine the final berry texture. In addition, the CW of grape berry skin is of fundamental importance for winemaking, controlling secondary metabolite extractability. Grapevine varieties with contrasting CW characteristics generally respond differently to biotic and abiotic stresses. In the context of climate change, it is important to investigate the CW dynamics occurring upon different stresses, to define new adaptation strategies. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying CW modifications during grapevine berry fruit ripening, plant-pathogen interaction, or in response to environmental stresses, also considering the most recently published transcriptomic data. Furthermore, perspectives of new biotechnological approaches aiming at modifying the CW properties based on other crops' examples are also presented.",
