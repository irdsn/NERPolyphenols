  "abstract": "Dietary flavan-3-ols are known to mediate cardiovascular benefits. Currently, it is assumed that the levels of flavan-3-ol catabolites detected in humans, 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (γVL) and 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valeric acid (γVA), and their corresponding phase II metabolites, are determined exclusively by the action of the gut microbiome. However, a family of human proteins, paraoxonase (PON), can theoretically hydrolyze γVL metabolites into the corresponding γVAs. This study aims to determine if PON is involved in γVL and γVA metabolism in humans.",
