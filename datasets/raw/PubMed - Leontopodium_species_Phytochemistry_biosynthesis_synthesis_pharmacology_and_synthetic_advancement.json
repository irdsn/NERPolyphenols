  "abstract": "Leontopodium (the daisy family) is a well-known genus containing medicinal plants for potent antioxidant and skin protection. An overview of its several aspects is not available. The current study aims to offer the state-of-the-art of its phytochemistry, biosynthesis, synthesis, pharmacology, and synthetic advancement. The search for English references has relied on several main electronic sources: PubMed and Web of Science. The \"SCI-Finder\" was used to confirm chemical structures. The best keyword, \"Leontopodium\", was frequently used in finding literature. Data collection was performed from the 1970s to the present. A diverse structural phytochemicals (179 compounds) were recorded, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenoids, phthalides, lignans, and coumarins. Leontopodium constituents are essential for anti-inflammation, antioxidant, and living organ protection. The biosynthesis and synthesis of several metabolites were successfully proposed. Leolignin has played a great role in pharmacological evaluations, while its synthetic products has shown cardioprotective and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonistic enhancements. Technological advancements in the isolation and new synthetic production are expected. Although several clinical studies have been conducted, more and more trials are needed.",
