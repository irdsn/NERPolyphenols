  "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a malignant tumor that arises in the female reproductive system and is associated with a very high mortality rate. This is primarily due to the highly invasive nature of metastasis and recurrence. Transforming the immune environment from an immunosuppressive state to an anti-tumor state through the phenotypic transformation of tumor-associated macrophages is crucial for inhibiting the growth, metastasis, and recurrence of ovarian cancer.",
