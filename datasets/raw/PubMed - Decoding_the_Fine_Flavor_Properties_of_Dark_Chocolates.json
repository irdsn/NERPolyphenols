  "abstract": "Fine flavor properties of chocolates such as fruity, floral, and cocoa-like were decoded on a molecular level for the first time. The molecular compositions of six chocolates made out of liquors that were referenced with specific sensory attributes were analyzed. After the screening for odor-active molecules by aroma extract dilution analysis, selected compounds were quantitated with the overall aim to decode the distinct fine flavor attributes on a molecular level. Acidic and fruity flavor notes were associated with high dose over threshold factors (DoT factors) of acetic acid and fruity smelling esters such as ethyl 2-methylbutanaote, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, and 3-methylbutyl acetate, respectively. Cocoa-like and roasty flavor notes were associated with high DoT factors for 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethylfuran-3(2H)-one, and dimethyltrisulfane. The floral and astringent flavors were linked to high DoT factors of (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin B2, procyanidin C1, and 2-phenylethan-1-ol.",
