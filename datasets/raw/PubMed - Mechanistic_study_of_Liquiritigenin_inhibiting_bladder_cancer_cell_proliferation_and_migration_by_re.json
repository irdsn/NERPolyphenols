  "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) is the most common malignant tumor in the urinary system, with a significantly higher incidence in men than in women, severely impacting quality of life. The STING1 gene (stimulator of interferon genes 1) plays a critical role in innate immunity by recognizing abnormal DNA and activating immune signaling pathways, promoting the expression of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Liquiritigenin (LQG), a flavonoid compound extracted from licorice, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties, capable of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and invasion while regulating autophagy. This study aims to evaluate the role of LQG in regulating the STING1 gene and its anti-cancer mechanisms in bladder cancer.",
