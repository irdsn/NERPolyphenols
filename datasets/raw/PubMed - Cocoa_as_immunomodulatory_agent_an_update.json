  "title": "Cocoa as immunomodulatory agent: an update.",
  "abstract": "Cocoa is rich in polyphenols, mainly flavonoids, which correlate with several health benefits mediated by their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Cocoa and chocolate consumption have been reported to impact the regulation of the immune system, both in preclinical studies and in human trials. The mechanisms for immunomodulation can involve different effects of cocoa polyphenols on the immune system, acting as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-allergic agents, as well as the direct influence of cocoa on innate and acquired immunity, with cytokines production and activation of both lymphocyte-dependent and -independent pathways. Cocoa intake has been also correlated to changes in gut microbiota ecology and composition, also affecting the intestinal immune system. This review summarises the updates of the last two decades on cocoa as immunomodulatory agent and explores the health-related benefits of cocoa and chocolate intake.",
