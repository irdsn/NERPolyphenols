  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases have multifactorial pathogenesis, mainly involving neuroinflammatory processes. Finding drugs able to treat these diseases, expecially because for most of these diseases there are no effective drugs, and the current drugs cause undesired side effects, represent a crucial point. Most in vivo and in vitro studies have been concentrated on various aspects related to neurons (e.g. neuroprotection), however, there has not been focus on the prevention of early stages involving glial cell activation and neuroinflammation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that nutritional phytochemicals including polyphenols, the main active constituents of the Mediterranean diet, maintain redox balance and neuroprotection through the activation of hormetic vitagene pathway. Recent lipidomics data from our laboratory indicate mushrooms as strong nutritional neuronutrients with strongly activity against neuroinflammation in Meniere' diseaseas, a model of cochleovestibular neural degeneration, as well as in animal model of traumatic brain injury, or rotenone induced parkinson's disease. Moreover, HidroxÂ®, an aqueous extract of olive containing hydroxytyrosol, and Boswellia, acting as Nrf2 activators, promote resilience by enhancing the redox potential, and thus, regulate through hormetic mechanisms, cellular stress response mechanisms., Thus, modulation of cellular stress pathways, in particular vitagenes system, may be an innovative approach for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disorders.",
