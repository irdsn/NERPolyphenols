  "title": "Propolis: A comprehensive review on the nature's polyphenolic wonder.",
  "abstract": "Propolis, a resinous substance produced by honeybees, has been utilized in traditional medicine for centuries due to its diverse biological activities. This review explores the phytochemical composition, therapeutic applications, and potential health benefits of propolis. Comprising a complex mixture of resins, waxes, essential oils, and pollen, propolis exhibits significant antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer properties. The phytochemical content of propolis varies with its botanical and geographical origins, influencing its bioactivity. Propolis has shown promise in wound healing, oral health, cardiovascular protection, neuroprotection, hepatoprotection, and gastrointestinal health. Despite its therapeutic potential, challenges such as standardization, quality control, and regulatory issues need to be addressed. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms of action, optimizing extraction methods, and conducting extensive clinical trials to validate its efficacy and safety. Sustainable production and conservation efforts are essential to ensure the continuous supply of high- quality propolis. This review highlights the need for interdisciplinary research to fully harness the potential of propolis in modern medicine.",
