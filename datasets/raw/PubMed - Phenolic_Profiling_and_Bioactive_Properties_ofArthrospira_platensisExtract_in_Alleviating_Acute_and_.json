  "abstract": "Arthrospira platensis, a filamentous photosynthetic cyanobacterium, is widely recognized for its high nutritional value, broad spectrum of bioactive compounds, and excellent safety profile, making it a promising natural source for health-promoting applications. This study aimed to profile the phenolic constituents of an ethanolic extract ofA. platensis(EAP) using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS and to investigate its pharmacological effects in attenuating acute and sub-chronic experimental colitis, as well as its antioxidant and antifungal properties. Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS), followed by oral administration of EAP at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Phenolic profiling revealed eight major compounds, with a cumulative content of 6.777 mg/g of extract, with Pyrogallol, Ferulic acid, and Chlorogenic acid being the most abundant. In vivo, EAP treatment significantly reduced the Disease Activity Index (DAI), alleviated macroscopic colonic damage, and preserved colonic mucosal integrity in both inflammatory phases. Biochemical analyses revealed significant reductions in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, accompanied by increased reduced glutathione (GSH) content and catalase activity. In vitro, EAP demonstrated notable antioxidant effects, including 56% DPPH and 47% ABTS radical scavenging activities, and an 81% ferrous ion-chelating capacity. Furthermore, it exhibited antifungal activity, with inhibition zones of 20 mm againstCandida albicansand 15 mm againstAspergillus flavus, respectively. These findings highlight the multitarget bioactivity of EAP and support its potential as a natural agent for managing intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress across both acute and sub-chronic phases.",
