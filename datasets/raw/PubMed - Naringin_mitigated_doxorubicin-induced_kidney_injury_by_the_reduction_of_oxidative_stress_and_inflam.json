  "abstract": "The pathophysiology and severity of kidney impairment due to doxorubicin (DOX) treatment are markedly influenced by oxidative stress and inflammation. Naringin (NG), a natural flavonoid, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The nephroprotective effect of NG on DOX-induced kidney toxicity was investigated to increase its utility in clinical settings.",
