  "abstract": "Recent research highlights the significant role of polyphenols in alleviating post-exercise muscle damage, thus positioning them as a valuable nutritional strategy for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Polyphenols, naturally occurring bioactive compounds abundant in fruits, vegetables, tea, wine, and other plant-based foods, are recognized for their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This dual mechanism is critical for combating oxidative stress and inflammation-two factors that intensify during vigorous physical activity and contribute to muscle soreness and damage. Among various polyphenols, compounds like quercetin have particularly emerged as effective agents for promoting muscle recovery and enhancing exercise performance. These protective effects are facilitated through several mechanisms, including the modulation of inflammatory pathways, acceleration of muscle repair processes, and enhancement of mitochondrial function, all of which bolster overall muscle health. As ongoing studies yield deeper insights, the potential of polyphenols to enhance athletic performance and overall health will become increasingly substantiated, leading towards their strategic incorporation into exercise nutrition protocols. Therefore, we reviewed relevant studies in order to show how efficient polyphenols can be in reducing muscle fatigue and damage and what are the exact mechanisms.",
