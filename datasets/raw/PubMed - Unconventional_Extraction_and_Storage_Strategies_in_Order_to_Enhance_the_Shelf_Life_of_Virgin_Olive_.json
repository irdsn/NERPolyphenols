  "abstract": "Virgin olive oil (VOO) is a globally esteemed product renowned for its chemical composition, nutritional value, and health benefits. Consumers seeking natural, nutritious, and healthy foods increasingly favor VOO. The optimization of the extraction system ensures the production of high-quality VOO with abundant antioxidant compounds that naturally protect it from degradation. Proper storage is crucial in maintaining the quality of VOO, prompting the exploration of novel extraction and preservation techniques. Factors such as light, temperature, and oxygen greatly influence the degradation process, resulting in reduced levels of natural antioxidants like polyphenols. Undesirable by-products and non-aromatic compounds may be formed, making the oil unacceptable over time. On the basis of all this consideration, this study aimed to evaluate the synergic use of two different gases (CO2and argon) during the malaxation phase to limit radical development and delay lipid autoxidation. Additionally, unconventional preservation systems, namely argon headspace, shellac, and bottle in bag, were assessed over a period of 150 days. The results evidenced that the use of CO2and argon during the malaxation process resulted in an improvement in the oil quality compared to the one obtained with the traditional system. However, in traditional oils, the alternative packaging systems determined interesting outcomes as they were able to positively affect different parameters, while the packaging effect was more mitigated in the test oils.",
