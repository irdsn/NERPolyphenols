  "abstract": "The topmost deadliest microorganism, namely, methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA), causes dreadful infections like bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and systemic inflammations. The virulence factors associated with MRSA exhibit multidrug-resistant characteristics, complicating treatment choices. So, the primary objective of this study is to identify the MRSA virulence factors and inhibiting its activity utilizing bioinformatic approaches.",
