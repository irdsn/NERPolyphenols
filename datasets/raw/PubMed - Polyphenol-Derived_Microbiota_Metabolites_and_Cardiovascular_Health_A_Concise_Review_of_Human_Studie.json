  "abstract": "Polyphenols, plant-derived secondary metabolites, play crucial roles in plant stress responses, growth regulation, and environmental interactions. In humans, polyphenols are associated with various health benefits, particularly in cardiometabolic health. Despite growing evidence of polyphenols' health-promoting effects, their mechanisms remain poorly understood due to high interindividual variability in bioavailability and metabolism. Recent research highlights the bidirectional relationship between dietary polyphenols and the gut microbiota, which can influence polyphenol metabolism and, conversely, be modulated by polyphenol intake. In this concise review, we summarized recent advances in this area, with a special focus on isoflavones and ellagitannins and their corresponding metabotypes, and their effect on cardiovascular health. Human observational studies published in the past 10 years provide evidence for a consistent association of isoflavones and ellagitannins and their metabotypes with better cardiovascular risk factors. However, interventional studies with dietary polyphenols or isolated microbial metabolites indicate that the polyphenol-gut microbiota interrelationship is complex and not yet fully elucidated. Finally, we highlighted various pending research questions that will help identify effective targets for intervention with precision nutrition, thus maximizing individual responses to dietary and lifestyle interventions and improving human health.",
