  "abstract": "Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is a multipurpose dietary and medicinal plant known for its ability to promote various health benefits. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex metabolic disorder driving health and socioeconomic challenges worldwide. It may be characterized by insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This study aims to conduct a review of pomegranate's effects on MetS parameters using a mechanistic approach relying on pre-clinical studies. The peel, juice, roots, bark, seeds, flowers, and leaves of the fruit present several bioactive compounds that are related mainly to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as cardioprotective, antidiabetic, and antiobesity effects. The use of the juice extract can work as a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, consequently regulating blood pressure. The major bioactive compounds found within the fruit are phenolic compounds (hydrolysable tannins and flavonoids) and fatty acids. Alkaloids, punicalagin, ellagitannins, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, tannins, flavonoids, luteolin, and punicic acid are also present. The antihyperglycemia, antihyperlipidemia, and weight loss promoting effects are likely related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. When considering clinical application, pomegranate extracts are found to be frequently well-tolerated, further supporting its efficacy as a treatment modality. We suggest that pomegranate fruit, extract, or processed products can be used to counteract MetS-related risk factors. This review represents an important step towards exploring potential avenues for further research in this area.",
