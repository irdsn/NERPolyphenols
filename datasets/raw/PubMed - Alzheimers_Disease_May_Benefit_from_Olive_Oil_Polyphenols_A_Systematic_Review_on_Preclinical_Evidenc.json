  "abstract": "Mediterranean diet may enhance cognitive function and delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effect of oleocanthal (OC) from extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) on amyloid-β (Aβ) burden in preclinical models of AD, considering the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of EVOO biophenols, which are key components of the Mediterranean dietary model.",
