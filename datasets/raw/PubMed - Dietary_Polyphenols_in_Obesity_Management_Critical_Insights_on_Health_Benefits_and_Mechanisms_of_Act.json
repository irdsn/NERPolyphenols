  "title": "Dietary Polyphenols in Obesity Management: Critical Insights on Health Benefits and Mechanisms of Action.",
  "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health concern that increases the risk of diseases associated with metabolic disorders. Polyphenols, an important plant-derived phytonutrient, are widely present in diets. The dietary polyphenols have great potential to be used in reducing obesity and obesity-related diseases. Purposely, this review aims to summarize the current research on the relationship between dietary polyphenols and obesity. We elucidated the pathophysiology and current treatment strategies for obesity, as well as outlined the dietary sources of polyphenols and their metabolism in humans. Particularly, the potential antiobesity properties of dietary polyphenols in experimental animals and clinical tests are highlighted. We further provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of dietary polyphenols on obesity. Upcoming investigations need to focus on the effects of food processing and human metabolic activity on polyphenols to improve the biological functions of polyphenols in foods and their precise delivery and bioavailability in the body. Conclusively, our work discussed the hotpots of polyphenols bioavailability, exploitation, and beneficial effects on obesity, which provides valuable information for polyphenols in antiobesity.",
