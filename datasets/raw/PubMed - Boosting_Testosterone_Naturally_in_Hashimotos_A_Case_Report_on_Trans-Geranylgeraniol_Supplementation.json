  "title": "Boosting Testosterone Naturally in Hashimoto's: A Case Report on Trans-Geranylgeraniol Supplementation.",
  "abstract": "This case report details an integrative nutrition approach for a 27-year-old male diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, suboptimal testosterone levels, and gut dysbiosis. Initially diagnosed in 2020, the patient presented with persistent thyroid autoimmunity and vitamin D insufficiency, but maintained stable androgen levels until 2023. Early interventions focused on foundational strategies, including anti-inflammatory dietary modifications, removal of gluten and dairy, and repletion of key nutrients such as vitamin D3/K2. Gut-directed therapies were added to support microbial diversity and intestinal barrier function, using digestive enzymes and increased intake of polyphenol-rich foods. Thyroid biomarkers showed steady improvement with these interventions. However, in 2023, the patient began to experience declining testosterone levels, accompanied by decreased muscle mass and athletic performance. To address this, a targeted supplementation protocol was introduced: 600 mg/day (two 300 mg capsules) of trans-geranylgeraniol (Annatto-GGâ„¢ 300) for nine weeks. Over the nine weeks, this intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful increase in total testosterone, accompanied by notable improvements in strength and physical performance. This case highlights the critical interplay between immune function, endocrine balance, and gastrointestinal health, illustrating the efficacy of a multifaceted, non-pharmacological approach in optimizing hormonal regulation and metabolic resilience. The findings emphasize the necessity of a systems-based, integrative framework in addressing complex, interrelated physiological imbalances.",
