  "abstract": "Packaging meat products with natural polymers containing antioxidants and antimicrobial agents is a potent method for improving storage quality. In this study, eco-friendly preservation materials for the heat-treated sucuks (HTSs) were developed by incorporating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and neem oil (NO) into the locust bean gum (LBG) matrix. The physicochemical, barrier, mechanical properties, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of biodegradable polymer films and their impacts on the storage quality of HTSs were evaluated. All films exhibited varying levels of antioxidant activity, depending on the AgNP and NO ratios. Also, the antimicrobial activity of films varied based on the film compositions and the tested microorganisms. The two films demonstrating the best properties among the prepared films were applied to HTS slices as coating solutions. The obtained results demonstrate that the AgNP/NO-loaded LBG coatings have contributed to preserving the storage quality of sucuk slices by suppressing microbial growth and slowing down lipid oxidation.",
