  "abstract": "Green tea consumption is associated with health benefits, which are mainly attributed to its catechins, especially the main catechin (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Among other beneficial effects, EGCG was shown to be protective in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a condition associated with barrier dysfunction. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this, the present study analyzed the impact of EGCG on barrier properties and inflammatory cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction in three different intestinal cell models.",
