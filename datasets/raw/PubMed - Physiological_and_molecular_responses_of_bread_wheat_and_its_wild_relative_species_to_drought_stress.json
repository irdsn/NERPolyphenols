  "abstract": "Drought stress is a major abiotic factor limiting wheat productivity and threatening global food security. Understanding the mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in wheat and its wild relatives offers critical insights for breeding more tolerant cultivars. In this study, we investigated the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and three of its wild relatives-Aegilops tauschii (genome DD), Ae. speltoides (genome BB), and T. urartu (genome AA)-under varying drought stress conditions to evaluate their adaptive strategies.",
