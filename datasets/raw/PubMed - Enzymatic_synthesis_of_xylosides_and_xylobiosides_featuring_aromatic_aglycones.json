  "abstract": "Î²-d-Xylopyranosides bearing a hydrophobic aglycon have been known for over fifty years as compounds that can enter cells and act as primers for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains. A range of aromatic xylosides and xylobiosides were prepared by a xylanase-catalyzed transglycosylation reaction from commercially available beechwood xylans and aromatic alcohols. A comparison in the reactivity of aromatic primary alcohols and the corresponding aromatic alcohols with a phenol group showed better results for transglycosylation reactions with the latter. A comparison was also carried out for transglycosylation reactions with phenol and diphenol acceptors.",
