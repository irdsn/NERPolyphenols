  "title": "Improvement of chronic metabolic inflammation and regulation of gut homeostasis: Tea as a potential therapy.",
  "abstract": "Chronic metabolic inflammation is a common mechanism linked to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic metabolic inflammation often related to alterations in gut homeostasis, and pathological processes involve the activation of endotoxin receptors, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruption of intestinal nuclear receptor activity. Recent investigations into homeostasis and chronic metabolic inflammation have revealed a novel mechanism which is characterized by a timing interaction involving multiple components and targets. This article explores the positive impact of tea consumption on metabolic health of populations, with a special focus on the improvement of inflammatory indicators and the regulation of gut microbiota. Studies showed that tea consumption is related to the enrichment of gut microbiota. The relative proportion of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) is altered, while the abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and A. muciniphila increased significantly in most of the studies. Thus, tea consumption could provide potential protection from the development of chronic diseases by improving gut homeostasis and reducing chronic metabolic inflammation. The direct impact of tea on intestinal homeostasis primarily targets lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-related pathways. This includes reducing the synthesis of intestinal LPS, inhibiting LPS translocation, and preventing the binding of LPS to TLR4 receptors to block downstream inflammatory pathways. The TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB p65 pathway is crucial for anti-metaflammatory responses. The antioxidant properties of tea are linked to enhancing mitochondrial function and mitigating mitochondria-related inflammation by eliminating free radicals, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasomes, and modulating Nrf2/ARE activity. Tea also contributes to safeguarding the intestinal barrier through various mechanisms, such as promoting the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids in the intestine, activating intestinal aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and improving enteritis. Functional components that improve chronic metabolic inflammation include tea polyphenols, tea pigments, TPS, etc. Tea metabolites such as 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3,4-Dihydroxyflavan derivatives, etc., also contribute to anti-chronic metabolic inflammation effects of tea consumption. The raw materials and processing technologies affect the functional component compositions of tea; therefore, consuming different types of tea may result in varying action characteristics and mechanisms. However, there is currently limited elaboration on this aspect. Future research should conduct in-depth studies on the mechanism of tea and its functional components in improving chronic metabolic inflammation. Researchers should pay attention to whether there are interactions between tea and other foods or drugs, explore safe and effective usage and dosage, and investigate whether there are individual differences in the tea-drinking population leading to different effects of tea intervention. Ultimately, the application of tea drinking could be a universal therapy for regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-chronic metabolic inflammatory responses, and promoting metabolic health.",
