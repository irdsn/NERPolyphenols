  "abstract": "Lichens contain different types of chemical compounds with multiple biological activities that demonstrate their potential pharmacological use. This research aims to report the metabolomic identification of the ethanolic extracts ofP. antarcticumandP. hypnorum, their antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and their cytoprotection activity. Sixteen metabolites were identified inP. antarcticumand twelve inP. hypnorum; the extracts reported variable antioxidant activity with IC50>350 µg/mL in DPPH·, values >18 µmol Trolox/g in ORAC and >40 µmol Trolox/g in FRAP and a phenolic compound content >10 mg GAE/g, as well as significant results in cholinesterases, α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, α-amylase, and tyrosinase enzyme inhibition activities with IC50ranging from 18 to 510 µg/mL, and which were complemented by molecular docking experiments. Both extracts showed improved cytoprotection at the concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 μg/mL. This study contributes to the knowledge of the chemical diversity of Antarctic lichen extracts and their effectiveness in the evaluation of biological activities related to neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic syndrome.",
