  "abstract": "High-altitude environments are characterized by low oxygen and reduced low pressure, which impose significant physiological challenges on organisms. Among various adaptive systems, the intestinal flora plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health and barrier integrity function under such conditions. This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of intestinal flora in high-altitude environments, focusing on downregulating intracellular Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) to influence glycolysis metabolism, thereby affecting intercellular communication of the intestinal mucosal barrier and matrix remodeling.",
