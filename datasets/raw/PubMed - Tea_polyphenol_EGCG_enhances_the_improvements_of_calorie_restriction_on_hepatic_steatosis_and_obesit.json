  "abstract": "Currently, calorie restriction (CR) is popular among young people as a way to lose weight and prevent obesity. However, CR can also cause a series of side effects, such as weight regain after resuming free eating. Tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been widely recognized as antiobesity effects. However, whether EGCG can enhance the antiobesity effect of CR and reduce its adverse outcomes is still unclear.",
