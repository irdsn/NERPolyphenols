  "title": "Ultrasonic intervention of Lactobacillus plantarum for quality enhancement of fermented jujube juice: Physicochemical and flavor properties.",
  "abstract": "In this study, ultrasonic intervention (UI) was used to treat Lactobacillus plantarum CICC 20022 (L. plantarum CICC 20022) at different phases and fermentation experiments were conducted with jujube juice: lag phase (UI 1), logarithmic phase (UI 2), stationary phase (UI 3) and decline phase (UI 4). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations and biochemical activity analyses revealed that UI 2 treatment significantly altered the cell surface structure from smooth to porous, while increasing the activities of H+-ATPase and β-glucosidase (41.93 μmol/(mg/min) and 0.07 U/mL, respectively). Fermentation with UI 2 resulted in a significant increase in total phenolics and flavonoids in jujube juice by 19.05 % and 54.17 %, respectively. In addition, the contents of gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and cinnamic acid in the fermented jujube juice were significantly increased by 2.92, 0.46, 0.18, 0.77, 0.81, 1.98 and 1.65 times compared to that of jujube juice fermented with L. plantarum CICC 20022 without UI (P < 0.05). Volatile compounds analysis showed an increase in esters and alcohols in the UI 2-treated samples, enriching the aroma profile. Principal component analysis (PCA) further delineated the differences in the aroma profile of fermented jujube juice at different phases of UI treatment. In conclusion, UI 2 treatment optimally improved the quality of fermented jujube juice, providing a novel approach for the optimization of fermentation processes.",
