  "abstract": "Significant progress has been achieved in the development of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs), focusing on enhancing their performance and expanding their applications. Efforts are particularly directed at increasing water absorbency while promoting environmental sustainability. Biodegradable materials such as starch and potassium humate have been successfully integrated with SAPs for desert greening, improving water retention, salt resistance, and seedling survival. The inclusion of nutrient-rich organic-inorganic composites further enhances the durability, efficiency, and recyclability of SAPs. In drought mitigation, polymeric absorbent resins such as polyacrylamide and starch-grafted acrylates have shown efficacy in ameliorating soil conditions and fostering plant growth. In arid environments, agents enriched with humic acid and bentonite contribute to improved soil aeration and water retention, creating optimal conditions for plant establishment. Additionally, the adoption of innovative waste management solutions has led to the production of amphiphilic SAPs from residual sludge, effectively addressing soil nutrient deficiencies and environmental pollution. In the food industry, SAPs containing protease, tea polyphenols, and chitosan exhibit potential for enhancing the stability and quality of seafood products. These advancements highlight the growing relevance of structural optimization approaches in SAP development across diverse applications and underline the importance of continued innovation in these fields. As novel materials emerge and environmental challenges intensify, the potential applications of SAPs are anticipated to expand significantly.",
