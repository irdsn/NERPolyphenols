  "abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) significantly contribute to health issues by interfering with hormonal functions. Bisphenol A (BPA), a prominent EDC, is extensively utilized as a monomer and plasticizer in producing polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, making it one of the highest-demanded chemicals in commercial use. This is the major component used in plastic products, including bottles, containers, storage items, and food serving ware. Exposure of BPA happens through oral, respiratory, transdermal routes and eye contact. As an EDC, BPA disrupts hormonal binding, leading to various health problems, such as cancers, reproductive abnormalities, metabolic syndrome, immune dysfunction, neurological effects, cardiovascular problems, respiratory issues, and obesity. BPA mimics the hormone estrogen but exhibits a weak affinity for estrogen receptors. This weak binding affinity triggers multiple cell death pathways, including necroptosis, pyroptosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy, across different cell types. Numerous clinical,in-vitro, andin-vivoexperiments have demonstrated that BPA exposure results in unfavorable health effects. This review highlights the mechanisms of cell death pathways initiated through BPA exposure and the associated negative health consequences. The extensive use of BPA and its frequent detection in environmental and biological models underscore the urgent need for further investigation into its effects and the development of safe alternatives. Addressing the health risks posed by BPA involves a comprehensive approach that includes reducing exposure and finding novel substitutes to lessen its detrimental impact on humans.",
