  "abstract": "Wildland fires have become progressively more extensive over the past 30 years in the United States, routinely generating smoke that deteriorates air quality for most of the country. We explored the neurometabolomic impact of biomass-derived smoke on older (18 months) female C57BL/6J mice, both acutely and after 10 weeks of recovery from exposures.",
