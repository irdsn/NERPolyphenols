  "abstract": "Food waste (FW) valorization provides a sustainable solution to global waste challenges by enhancing resource efficiency and enabling a circular bioeconomy. This review highlights the need to shift from linear disposal to circular strategies and assesses key FW valorization methods, including thermochemical (pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal carbonization), biological (composting, anaerobic digestion, microbial fermentation), and green extraction techniques (cold plasma, supercritical fluid, microwave-assisted extraction). While FW-to-biofuel conversion is established, producing high-value platform chemicals such as organic acids and phenolics offers greater economic potential, though with added complexity. Each method has its own set of trade-offs. For instance, thermochemical routes are simple but energy-intensive, while biological processes are slower but more sustainable. Green extraction is rapid, but it faces challenges in scaling up. To address these limitations, this perspective emphasizes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of things (IoT) to enhance process efficiency and enable the development of smart biorefineries. Overall, the review proposes a strategic roadmap for large-scale FW valorization, which aims to promote sustainable development and advance circular bioeconomy frameworks.",
