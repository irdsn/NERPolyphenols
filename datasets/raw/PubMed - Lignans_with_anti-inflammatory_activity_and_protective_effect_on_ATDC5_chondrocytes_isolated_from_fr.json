  "abstract": "Three previously unreported compounds (1-3), including two monoepoxidelignans (1-2) and one bisepoxylignan (3), together with nineteen known lignans (4-22), of which, fourteen compounds (7-17 and 20-22) were first reported from the genus Sambucus L. Their structures were comprehensively elucidated through spectroscopic methods, and their configurations were established by ECD calculations. Among the compounds, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 15 could significantly reduce the contents of NO in IL-1β-stimulated ATDC5 chondrocytes. In addition, the IL-6 mRNA expression levels with 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16 and 18 were significantly reduced. Moreover, 15 displayed inhibitory activity against the catabolism of ATDC5 chondrocytes, and promoted the synthesis of COL II in IL-1β-stimulated ATDC5 chondrocytes, indicated that there were protective effects on ATDC5 chondrocytes. The binding sites were predicted by molecular docking. The aforementioned results indicated that these compounds may be the active substances in S. adnata wall. That exert anti-osteoarthritis effects.",
