  "title": "Morin: a promising hepatoprotective agent against drug and chemical-induced liver injury.",
  "abstract": "Morin, a naturally occurring flavonoid found in various fruits and medicinal plants, has long been recognized in ethnopharmacological practices for its therapeutic potential. While its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been appreciated historically, recent molecular studies have begun to uncover the precise mechanisms underlying its protective actions, particularly in the context of liver toxicity induced by drugs and chemicals. Morin has demonstrated significant hepatoprotective effects through its ability to attenuate oxidative stress, suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, and regulate apoptotic pathways in hepatocytes. Multiple cellular targets and signaling pathways, including Nrf2/HO-1, NF-ÎºB, MAPK, SphK1/S1P, and ADMA/DDAH, have been shown to be modulated by morin, indicating its multi-faceted protective profile. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of morin to enhance understanding of its therapeutic potential and support its future clinical application against drug- and chemical-induced liver injury.",
