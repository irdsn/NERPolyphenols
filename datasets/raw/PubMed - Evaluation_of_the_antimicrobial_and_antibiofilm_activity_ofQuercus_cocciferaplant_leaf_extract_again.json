  "abstract": "The escalating global threat posed by antimicrobial resistance has intensified the search for novel antimicrobial agents. Plant-derived bioactive compounds represent a promising reservoir due to their chemical diversity and efficacy against resistant pathogens.Quercusspecies, traditionally utilized in herbal medicine, have shown significant bioactive potential. However, research specifically evaluating the antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties ofQuercus cocciferaremains limited. This study aimed to investigate the phytochemical composition, antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and antioxidant activities ofQ. cocciferaleaf extracts using various extraction methods and solvents with differing polarities.",
