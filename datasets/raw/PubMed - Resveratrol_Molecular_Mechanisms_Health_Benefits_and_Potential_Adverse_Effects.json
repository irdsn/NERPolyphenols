  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RES), a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, has garnered significant attention due to its diverse biological activities, which include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiaging properties. This review synthesizes current evidence concerning the molecular mechanisms, therapeutic efficacy, and safety profile of RES across a variety of pathologies, with an emphasis on the latest research conducted in recent years. Mechanistically, RES is known to modulate critical signaling pathways such as the activation of sirtuin 1. These actions collectively contribute to the attenuation of oxidative stress, regulation of apoptosis, and promotion of autophagy. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of RES in the mitigation of degenerative musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer progression, and neurological diseases. Given the low bioavailability of RES and the potential for adverse reactions in clinical applications, we summarize and discuss its safety profile while outlining future research directions. This review underscores the therapeutic versatility of RES while advocating for rigorous pharmacokinetic optimization, standardized dosing protocols, and large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate its efficacy and safety in human populations.",
