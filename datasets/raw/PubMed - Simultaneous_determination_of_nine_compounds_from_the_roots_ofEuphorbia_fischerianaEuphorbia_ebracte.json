  "abstract": "Langdu is generally considered as the roots ofEuphorbia fischeriana,Euphorbia ebracteolataandStellera chamaejasme. However, whether these three plants can substitute for one another has always been a concern. This article aims to clarify the differences among the three Langdu species in chemical constituentsÂ and anti-tumor effects. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of eight diterpenoids and one flavonoid in Langdu samples and IC50curves for these compounds, which can serve as a basis for identification and usage.",
