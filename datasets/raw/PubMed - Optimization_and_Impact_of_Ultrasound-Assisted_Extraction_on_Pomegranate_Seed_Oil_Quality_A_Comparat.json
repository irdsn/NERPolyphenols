  "title": "Optimization and Impact of Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction on Pomegranate Seed Oil Quality: A Comparative Study of Bioactive Potential and Oxidation Parameters.",
  "abstract": "Pomegranate seed oil (PSO), a by-product of juice production, is rich in bioactive compounds, especially punicic acid, and has significant potential for health and industrial applications. The present study aimed to optimize an ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of PSO and compare its effectiveness with conventional methods such as cold pressing and Soxhlet extraction. A Box-Behnken design was used to determine the optimal UAE parameters (amplitude 46%, 12 min, L/S ratio 19 mL/g), yielding 12.67% oil with the highest oxidative stability (Ï„max= 5.44 min). Compared to Soxhlet and cold-pressed methods, UAE gave the highest yield, but slightly lower levels of total polyphenols and antioxidant activity. Cold-pressed oil retained the most bioactive compounds, but showed reduced oxidative stability and higher susceptibility to degradation. Soxhlet extraction provided moderate antioxidant capacity and the highest punicic acid content, but exceeded the recommended limits for acid value. Overall, the UAE offers an effective balance between yield, quality, and sustainability, with minimal thermal degradation and reduced solvent consumption. The results confirm that UAE is a promising alternative for high-quality PSO extraction, although cold pressing remains superior in preserving sensitive bioactive components. Ultimately, this study underscores that the extraction method plays a decisive role in determining the functional quality and oxidative stability of PSO, with UAE standing out as the most efficient and environmentally favorable approach.",
