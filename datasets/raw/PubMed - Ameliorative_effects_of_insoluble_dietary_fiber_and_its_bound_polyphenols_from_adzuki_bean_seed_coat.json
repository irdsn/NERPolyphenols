  "abstract": "The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is closely associated with dietary fiber (DF) intake. This study aims to evaluate the ameliorative effects of insoluble dietary fiber from adzuki bean seed coat (AIDF) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice, both with and without bound polyphenols (BPs). We employed a model based on the \"remove/backfill\" of components. Compared to dephenolized dietary fiber (AIDF-DF) and AIDF-DF with replaced BPs (AIDF-BP), AIDF was found to effectively reduce the splenic index, alleviate colonic histopathological damage, lower serum levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6), decrease activities of LPS, DAO, MPO, and iNOS, regulate intestinal tight junction (TJ) mRNA and protein expression, and restore the integrity of the colonic epithelial cell barrier. AIDF mitigated the inflammatory response in UC by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway. It increased the abundance of beneficial gut microbiota (e.g., Akkermansia, Verrucomicrobiota) while reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria (e.g., Proteobacteria), thereby alleviating intestinal disturbances in DSS-induced colitis in mice. In conclusion, the presence of BPs in AIDF plays a critical role in attenuating DSS-induced UC in mice.",
