  "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a recurrent intestinal disease caused by a complex of factors, and there are serious adverse effects and tolerance problems associated with the current long-term use of therapeutic drugs. The development of natural food sources and multi-targeted drugs for the treatment of UC is imminent. Portulaca oleracea L. (PO), as a vegetable, has been shown in studies to have an anti-UC effects. However, the relationship between the abundant active ingredients contained in Portulaca oleracea L. and the improvement of intestinal barrier, gut microbiota and metabolites is unclear. In the present study, Portulaca oleracea L. which was found to be rich in phenolic acid-based active ingredients, were effective in alleviating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI) score and colon length in mice. It also decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) responses, reduced the permeation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evans blue (EB), and improved histopathological scores. Meanwhile, in vitro and in vivo validation revealed the protective effects of purslane on the intestinal barrier indicators ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1, and inhibited the expression of inflammation-associated iNOS and NLRP3 proteins through the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, purslane increased the diversity of the intestinal flora, enhancing the proportion of the genera Butyricoccus, Dorea and Bifidobacterium and decreasing the percentage of Bacteroides, Turicibacter and Parabacteroides. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that the imbalance of 39 metabolites was significantly reversed after PO deployment. Enrichment analysis showed that Pentose phosphate pathway and Pyruvate metabolism pathway were the key pathways of PO against UC. Overall, purslane effectively improved the intestinal barrier disruption and intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, and adjusted the disorder of gut microbiota and metabolites to exert anti-UC effects.",
