  "abstract": "Rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are chronic autoimmune disorders characterized by persistent inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to joint damage and reduced quality of life. In recent years, increasing attention has been given to diet as a modifiable environmental factor that can complement pharmacological therapy. This review summarizes current evidence on how key dietary components-such as omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, polyphenols, and antioxidant vitamins-affect inflammatory pathways and oxidative balance. Special emphasis is placed on the Mediterranean diet, low-starch diets, and hypocaloric regimens, which have shown potential in improving disease activity. The gut microbiota emerges as a critical mediator between diet and immune function, with dietary interventions capable of restoring eubiosis and strengthening the intestinal barrier. Additionally, this paper discusses challenges in the clinical implementation of diet therapy, the need for personalized nutritional strategies, and the importance of integrating diet into holistic patient care. Collectively, findings suggest that dietary interventions may reduce disease activity, mitigate systemic inflammation, and enhance patients' overall well-being.",
