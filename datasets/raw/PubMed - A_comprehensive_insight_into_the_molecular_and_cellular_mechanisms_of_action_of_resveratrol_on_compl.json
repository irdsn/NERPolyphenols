  "title": "A comprehensive insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of resveratrol on complications of sepsis a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "Sepsis and septic shock are still one of the most important medical challenges. Sepsis is an extreme and uncontrolled response of the innate immune system to invading pathogenesis. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxytrans-stilbene), is a phenolic and non-flavonoid compound naturally produced by some plants and fruits. The object of the current study is to systematically review the impacts of resveratrol and its mechanisms of function in the management of sepsis and its related complications. The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statements were applied to perform the study (PROSPERO: CRD42021289357). We searched Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus databases up to January 2023 by using the relevant keywords. Study criteria were met by 72 out of 1415 articles screened. The results of this systematic review depict that resveratrol can reduces the complications of sepsis by affecting inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and modulating immune responses. Future human randomized clinical trials are necessary due to the promising therapeutic effects of resveratrol on sepsis complications and the lack of clinical trials in this regard.",
