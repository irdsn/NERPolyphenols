  "abstract": "Protein haze is a significant concern for the white wine industry, impacting sensory quality, stability, and consumer experience. The predominant treatment currently employed in production is bentonite, which leads to high costs and significant wine production losses, while also adsorbing certain aroma and flavor compounds. Therefore, there is a need for cost-effective and efficient methods that do not compromise the wine's flavor and aroma. In this study, spherical superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles, with a diameter of 26.0 ± 4.1 nm, were synthesized via a microwave heating method, and further modified with tannic acid (TA) to create structurally stable SPIO-TA. By leveraging the protein-binding properties of tannic acid via hydrogen and covalent bonds, and SPIO's magnetic function, a novel magnetic separation technology was devised to rapidly and efficiently remove hazy proteins from wine. Sauvignon Blanc (SB) and Petit Manseng (PM) wines were selected for experimental evaluation. The study demonstrated that SPIO-TA effectively prevents protein turbidity, as shown by assessments of wine color, turbidity, and thermal stability. The analysis of the main volatile compounds, organic acids, and polyphenolic substances in the treated wines revealed that SPIO-TA had minimal impact on the wine's primary aroma and flavor compounds. Moreover, SPIO-TA demonstrated the potential for regenerative reuse, and exhibited good biocompatibility, indicating its potential as an alternative method for white wine clarification.",
