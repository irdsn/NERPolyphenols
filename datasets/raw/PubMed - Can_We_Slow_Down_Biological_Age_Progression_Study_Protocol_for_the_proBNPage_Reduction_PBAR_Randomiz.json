  "title": "Can We Slow Down Biological Age Progression? Study Protocol for the proBNPage Reduction (PBAR) Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial (Effects of 4 \"Anti-Aging\" Food Supplements in Healthy Older Adults).",
  "abstract": "The availability of a simple and reliable marker of biological age might allow an acceleration of the research in the field of longevity extension. Previous studies suggest that this marker might be the N-terminal of B-type natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP), from which proBNPage, a biological age surrogate, can be calculated. Objectives of the study: 1) To fine-tune the method of proBNPage progression assessment and 2) To establish whether 4 \"anti-aging\" treatments, which provided promising results in previous studies, can modify proBNPage progression.",
