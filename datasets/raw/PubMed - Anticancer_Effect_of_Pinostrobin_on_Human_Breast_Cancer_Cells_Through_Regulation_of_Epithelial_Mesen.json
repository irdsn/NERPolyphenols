  "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer, with a high incidence of metastasis and chemoresistance. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the molecular mechanisms that has been linked to the promotion of metastasis, and it can be promoted by several activators including the NF-κB signaling pathway. As a result, targeting EMT may be a potential strategy for treating TNBC. Pinostrobin is one of the important flavonoids found in the rhizome and rootlet ofBoesenbergia rotunda(L.) Mansf. (fingerroot) that exhibits anticancer activities. However, the precise mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of pinostrobin on breast cancer remains unclear, and additional evidence is needed. In this study, the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of pinostrobin. To determine the effect of pinostrobin on cell viability, an MTT assay was performed. Wound healing and Transwell chamber assays were conducted to examine the effect of pinostrobin on migration ability. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of mRNA involved in NF-κB and EMT signaling pathways. The results revealed that low concentrations of pinostrobin did not affect cell viability, while higher concentrations produced an inhibitory effect on the viability of both cell lines. Pinostrobin also impeded migration and suppressed the expression of N-cadherin, a mesenchymal marker. Molecular docking analysis also suggested that the pinostrobin may target N-cadherin with higher binding affinity than IKK complex and NF-κB p65. These findings indicate that pinostrobin may serve as a potential treatment for TNBC.",
