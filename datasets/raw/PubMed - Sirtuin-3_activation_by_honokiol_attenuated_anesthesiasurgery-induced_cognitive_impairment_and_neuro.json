  "abstract": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND), a prevalent neurological complication in elderly patients following anesthesia and surgery, has recently been linked to ferroptosis as a central pathogenic mechanism. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, exhibits neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative disorders, including PND. However, its role in neuronal ferroptosis during PND remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of SIRT3 on ferroptosis modulation in PND and its underlying mechanism.",
