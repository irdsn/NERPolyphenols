  "abstract": "Eugenia uniflora L. (Myrtaceae), commonly known as pitanga or Brazilian cherry, is widely used in traditional medicine across South America, particularly in Brazil's semi-arid regions, to treat fever, gastrointestinal disorders, and microbial infections. Its therapeutic potential is attributed to phenolic compounds such as myricitrin, gallic acid, and ellagic acid, which exhibit well-documented antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In the context of the growing global threat posed by multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens, especially species of the Candida genus, exploring natural sources like E. uniflora for antifungal drug development is both timely and necessary.",
