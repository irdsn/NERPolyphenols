  "title": "Associations between environmental chemical mixtures and anthropometric measures in Korean girls: a cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between environmental chemicals and anthropometric indices using preliminary data from the Puberty and Environment in Adolescents Cohort Project. Random urine samples from 370 Korean girls aged 7-14 years were evaluated for 15 environmental phthalates, phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites, and three heavy metals using growth metrics. We calculated the body mass index (BMI) z-score, weight z-score, height z-score, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) based on the World Health Organization growth references. Associations between environmental chemicals and weight and height indicators were assessed using single- and mixture-exposure models, controlling for the measured covariates. We identified 28 girls (7.6%) as overweight, 10 (2.7%) as underweight based on BMI z-scores, 17 (4.6%) as underweight based on weight z-scores, and 6 (1.6%) as having a low height status. Normal anthropometric measurements were reported in 85.9% of the girls. No positive associations between environmental chemical mixtures and BMI z-score, weight z-score, or WHR (β = -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.34, 0.26; -0.23, 95% CI: -0.51, 0.06; -0.00, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.02) were observed. A negative association was identified between environmental phthalate, phenol, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons metabolites, and height z-score (β = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.63, -0.19). Heavy metal mixtures were negatively associated with weight and height z-scores (β = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.04; -0.21, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.03).",
