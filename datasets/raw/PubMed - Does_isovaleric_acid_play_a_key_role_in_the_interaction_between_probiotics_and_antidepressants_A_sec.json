  "abstract": "Dysbiosis appears to be a significant contributor to the complex pathophysiology of mood disorders, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main metabolites produced in the colon by bacterial fermentation, have been found to play a role in gut-brain communication. Probiotics were shown to be effective in managing and alleviating depressive symptoms, especially as an add-on protocol. This study aimed to assess the change in fecal SCFAs levels after supplementation with probiotics in patients with depression, depending on baseline antidepressant treatment.",
