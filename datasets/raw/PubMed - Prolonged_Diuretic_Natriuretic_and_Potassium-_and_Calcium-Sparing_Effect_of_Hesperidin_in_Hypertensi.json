  "abstract": "Systemic hypertension is a major global health concern, significantly contributing to the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. Antihypertensive medications play a crucial role in lowering blood pressure, with diuretics serving as a particularly effective first-line therapy. However, the development of new compounds with diuretic properties, renal protective effects, and unique mechanisms of action remains a critical area of research for improving clinical outcomes. In this context, the present study investigated the diuretic and renal protective potential of the citrus flavonoid hesperidin in rats. Male spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats were treated with hesperidin at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg daily for seven days. Urine samples were analyzed for electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca2+), biochemical parameters, and crystal precipitation, while renal tissues were examined histologically. Hesperidin treatment resulted in significant diuretic and natriuretic effects, along with potassium- and calcium-sparing properties. Furthermore, a marked reduction in calcium oxalate crystal formation was observed in the hesperidin-treated group. Histological analysis indicated a protective effect on renal tissue, with structural preservation observed in hypertensive rats. Docking studies revealed that hesperetin, the active metabolite of hesperidin formed upon oral administration, exhibited a high binding affinity for the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). This hypothesis may explain its role in preventing urinary crystalluria and contributing to calcium-sparing effects.",
