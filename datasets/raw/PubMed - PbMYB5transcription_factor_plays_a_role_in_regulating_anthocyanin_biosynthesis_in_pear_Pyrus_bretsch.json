  "title": "PbMYB5transcription factor plays a role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd) skin.",
  "abstract": "The phenylacetone pathway, which encompasses flavonoids, lignin, and other compounds, is of paramount importance in determining the quality of pear fruit. Nevertheless, the precise regulatory functions of R2R3-MYB transcription factors in the metabolic pathways that regulate pear color changes remain unclear. In this study, we isolated anR2R3-PbMYB5(PbMYB5)transcription factor from 'Red Zaosu' pears and demonstrated that it influenced the expression of several genes, includingPbCAD1, PbF5H, PbLAR, PbANR, andPbUFGT. The overexpression ofPbMYB5resulted in a notable elevation in anthocyanin concentration within the pear epidermis. Further research has shown thatPbMYB5is able to bind toPbANSand also has interactions withPbbHLH3andPbbHLH33.We proposed thatPbMYB5forms a complex withPbbHLH3, PbbHLH33, andPbWD40to activatePbANSand promote anthocyanin accumulation. This study offers new insights into the regulation of various metabolic pathways that impact fruit coloration.",
