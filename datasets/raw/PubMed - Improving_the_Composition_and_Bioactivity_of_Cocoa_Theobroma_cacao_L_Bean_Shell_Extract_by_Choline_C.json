  "title": "Improving the Composition and Bioactivity of Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) Bean Shell Extract by Choline Chloride-Lactic Acid Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent Extraction Assisted by Pulsed Electric Field Pre-Treatment.",
  "abstract": "An environmentally friendly method for the release of cocoa bean shell (CBS) extracts is proposed in this paper. This work aims to investigate the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) pre-treatment on subsequent solid-liquid extraction (SLE) of metabolites with choline chloride-lactic acid natural deep eutectic solvent (NaDES) and bioactivity of cocoa bean shell (CBS) extract. Two different media for PEF application were evaluated: water and chlorine chloride-lactic acid. Total polyphenols (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC), individual major compounds, and antioxidant and antibacterial activity of CBS extracts were assessed. The performance of PEF-assisted extraction was compared with SLE and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The proposed method improved the release of TPC up to 45% and TFC up to 48% compared with the conventional extraction. The CBS extract showed medium growth inhibition of Escherichia coli and high growth inhibition of Salmonella sp, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, an extract with enhanced antioxidant and antibacterial properties was obtained.",
