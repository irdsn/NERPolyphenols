  "abstract": "Background: Resveratrol has been shown to modulate stress-related anxiety by reducing brain monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this neurochemical effect remains unknown. In this study, we employed in silico approaches to investigate the binding affinity of resveratrol and its predominant blood metabolite, resveratrol glucuronide, to specific sites on MAO-A.Methods: For the in silico analysis, we employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Within the liver-brain axis, we investigated the role of hepatic MAO-A in the development of anxiety. The activity of whole-brain MAO-A was compared with its activity in specific brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex.Results: Our findings suggest the presence of an allosteric site on the enzyme that accommodates these compounds. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that high-dose resveratrol suppresses MAO activity not only in the brain but also in the liver of stress-exposed rats. The in vivo results are interpreted in the context of an allosteric site on MAO-A in both the brain and liver, which may mediate the interaction with resveratrol and its metabolite.Conclusions: The primary outcomes of the study include the identification of the role of hepatic MAO-A in the development of anxiety-like behavior, as well as the determination of resveratrol dose ranges at which it functions as an allosteric modulator of MAO-A activity.",
