  "title": "Effect of collagen crosslinkers on sodium hypochlorite treated dentin bond strength: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "The bond strength (BS) between composite resin and dentin is a crucial factor determining the long-term success of restorations. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), a frequently used root canal irrigating agent, has been demonstrated to notably influence the properties of dentin, thereby affecting the BS. Moreover, the application of collagen crosslinkers has become a potential approach to improve the stability of the resin-dentin bond. Nevertheless, the effect of collagen crosslinkers on the bond strength (BS) between sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) treated dentin and composite resin remains a topic of contention, and there is a lack of in-depth understanding in the existing literature. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the current literature on the effect of collagen crosslinkers on the BS between sodium hypochlorite treated dentin and composite resin.",
