  "abstract": "According to the theory of five movements and six climates, the innate constitution plays a crucial role in determining the underlyingpa thological mechanisms of diseases later in life. Previous studies have demonstrated a close association between the constitution, as defined by the theory of five movements and six climates, and the development of various types of tumors. Furt hermore,the tumorsubtype determined by the constitution has prognostic implications. This highlights the potential of utilizing the fivemovements and six climates theory to guide the implementation of precision medicine strategies in thefield of oncology. However, no resear ch has yet been conducted to investigate the use of this theory in guiding the development of tumor molecular classification and precisi onmedicine strategies. The objective of this research is to uncover the biological characteristics of each constitution within a pancanc ercohort and identify potential anti-tumor drugs that are applicable to patients with different constitutional types. By doing so, we aimto c ontribute to the establishment of a precision medicine strategy for tumors derived from the original concepts of traditional Chi nesemedicine(TCM). In this study, we obtainedpan-cancer Bulk RNA-Seq data from UCSC Xena, GWAS cohort data from the UKBiobank, and cis-eQTLs data from eQ TLGen and GTEx V8. We employed machine learning methods to screen for hub genes associated with each constitution. Subsequently, we utilized informatics tools to explore the biological characteristics of each constitut iondefined by the theory of five movements and six bioclimates. Further, potential anti-tumor drugs suitable for patients with differen tconstitutional types were identified through mendelian randomization, molecular docking, and drug-like prediction techniques. Withinthe pan-cancer cohort, significant differences were observed among different constitutions in terms of progression-free interval, biological f unctions, immune cell abundance, tumor drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy response. These findings suggest that the five movements and six climates theory can guide tumor molecular classification and the development of precision medicine strategies. Moreover,the biological characteristics inherent to each constitution partially shed light on the scientific implications of Chinese medicinetheories, offering a fresh perspective towards clinical cancer treatment. Through molecular docking and drug-like prediction, several po tential anti-tumor drugs such as 17-beta-estradiol, serotonin, trans-resveratrol, and linoleic acid were identified. Overall, the util izationof multi-omics approaches pro vides a powerful tool to unravel the scientific foundations of TCM theories. The elucidation of themu lti-omics features associated witheach constitution in tumors serves as the basis for applying the five movements and six climates theoryto tumor molecular classification and the development of precision medicine strategies.",
