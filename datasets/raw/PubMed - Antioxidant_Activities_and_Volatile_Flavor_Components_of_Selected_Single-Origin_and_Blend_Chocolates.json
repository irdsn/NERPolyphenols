  "abstract": "The biological activity of chocolates gains more and more attention of consumers. Its antioxidant properties depend, among other factors, mainly on the origin of cocoa and the characteristics that this origin gives to the final product. Therefore, the aim of the study was to measure and compare the total content of polyphenols, antioxidant activity, and key odorants of commercial chocolates made from blend cocoa with single-origin ones. The highest content of polyphenols was found in 90% blend cocoa chocolate and single-origin samples, while the lowest content was exhibited by 100% chocolate from blend cocoa mass. The highest antioxidant activity measured by 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays was observed in the sample of chocolate with 90% cocoa solids from blend mass, followed by single-origin chocolates. A high positive correlation between ABTS assay and the total polyphenol and phenolic acids' content, as well as among the total content of polyphenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids was found. Mineral composition analysis showed that dark chocolate is a valuable source of some elements, especially Mg, Fe, and Zn. Potentially toxic elements were not detected or below permitted limits. Moreover, it was noticed that the main volatile compound in all tested samples was acetic acid, but pyrazines were considered the most important group of chocolate odorants.",
