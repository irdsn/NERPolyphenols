  "title": "The Current Findings on the Impact of Prenatal BPA Exposure on Metabolic Parameters: In Vivo and Epidemiological Evidence.",
  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a multifactorial disease entity and is not fully understood. Growing evidence suggests that early exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is a significant risk factor for the development of metabolic diseases. BPA is a monomer used in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics, thermal receipt paper, and epoxy resins. Owing to its widespread use, BPA has been detected in human fluids and tissues, including blood, placental breast milk, and follicular fluid. In the present review, we aimed to review the impact of prenatal exposure to different doses of BPA on metabolic parameters as determined by in vivo and epidemiological studies. The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched to identify articles published during a period of 15 years from 2006 to 2021, and 29 studies met the criteria. Most studies demonstrated that prenatal exposure to low BPA concentrations correlated with alterations in metabolic parameters in childhood and an increased risk of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in adulthood. Therefore, prenatal exposure to low doses of BPA may be associated with an increased risk of obesity and T2DM in a sex-specific manner.",
