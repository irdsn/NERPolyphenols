  "title": "Enhanced Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Properties of Albino Cordyceps militaris: A Comparative Study With Wild-type Strain.",
  "abstract": "Cordyceps militaris is a medicinal fungus known for its immunomodulatory effects. This study compared the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of an albino strain (C. militaris SHBTQ) and its wild-type counterpart (SHQ) using ethanol extracts from their fruiting bodies. The albino strain exhibited significantly higher bioactive compound levels, with cordycepin and pentostatin concentrations 2.37- and 1.74-fold higher than in the wild type. Enhanced polyphenol and flavonoid content correlated with stronger 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonate) radical scavenging (2.67- and 1.91-fold higher) and superior copper-chelating ability (97.52% vs. 51.83% at 5 mg/L). It also demonstrated greater anti-inflammatory effects, with a lower 50% inhibitory concentration in the bovine serum albumin denaturation assay (7.42 vs. 14.49 mg/mL) and reduced oxidative stress in zebrafish models. The superior bioactivity of SHBTQ, likely due to its high bioactive compound content, underscores its therapeutic potential against oxidative stress-related diseases.",
