  "abstract": "This study reports a comparative analysis of the polyphenolic composition and nutraceutical properties of different olive mill wastewater (OMWW) and corresponding extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) extracts. Specifically, four OMWWs and corresponding EVOOs from cultivars Frantoio (A) and Leccino (B) obtained from different crushing seasons (early-stage (A1 and B1) and later-stage (A2 and B2)) were analyzed. Employing HPLC-DAD and LC-MS methods, the primary polyphenol content was identified and quantified. Overall, OMWW extracts showed a greater polyphenolic content compared to corresponding EVOO extracts, with OMWW B1 displaying the highest levels of polyphenols. The antiradical properties of extracts towards radical species (DPPH, ABTS, O2-, and HOCl-) were demonstrated in vitro, revealing a correlation with polyphenolic content. In fact, OMWW B1 and B2 demonstrated the strongest antiradical activity. Exploring nutraceutical properties of OMWWs, the intestinal permeation of the main polyphenols in a co-culture model (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cell lines) was assessed, with tyrosol achieving a permeation of almost 60%. Furthermore, the involvement in the inflammation process has been evaluated in cell studies on THP1-derived macrophages by immunocytochemistry, demonstrating that OMWW B1 may exert an anti-inflammatory effect by modulating specific phenotype expression on macrophages. In conclusion, this study provides evidence supporting the reuse of OMWWs as a source of polyphenols with nutraceutical properties.",
