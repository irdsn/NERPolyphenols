  "abstract": "Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medical system, offers a comprehensive approach to health promotion, disease prevention, and body rejuvenation, emphasizing wellness, vitality, and holistic well-being. Triphala, a well-established polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, comprises equal proportions ofEmblica officinalis(Amalaki or Amla),Terminalia bellerica(Bibhitaki or Bahera), andTerminalia chebula(Haritaki or Harad), demonstrating exceptional efficacy in gastrointestinal health and rejuvenation therapy. Triphala Rasayana, a polyherbal formulation, has been employed in Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani medicine systems to address various health conditions. Its medicinal attributes include antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anticataract properties, making it a vital component in gastrointestinal treatment, particularly for functional gastrointestinal disorders. With its rich history in Ayurveda, Triphala's unique tridoshic properties harmonize the body's three essential energies - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha - fostering overall well-being and diverse health applications. The phytochemical composition of Triphala Rasayana is scrutinized, revealing essential bioactive compounds like phenolic acids, tannins, and flavonoids, which contribute to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. The therapeutic properties of Triphala span antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, and immunomodulatory effects, underpinned by studies demonstrating its benefits for oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, and immune enhancement. The review also underscores Triphala's role in gastrointestinal health, promoting beneficial microbiota and alleviating digestive issues, alongside its cardioprotective effects. Concluding with a call for advanced research into its pharmacodynamics and molecular mechanisms, the document advocates for integrating this potent Ayurvedic remedy into modern therapeutic regimens.",
