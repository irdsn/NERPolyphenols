  "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities characterized by obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. This study aimed to investigate the impact of moringa, rosemary and purslane leave water extracts on metabolic syndrome in rats. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Phenolic compounds in the plant leaves water extracts were determined by HPLC. Fifty adult male albino rats Sprague-Dawley strain were equally divided into five groups, group (1) Normal rats fed on the balanced diet, group (2) Metabolic syndrome rats fed on High Fat-High Fructose Diet (HF-HFD). The other three groups were fed on HF-HFD and orally administered 200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; b.wt. daily of the tested plant's leaves water extracts, respectively, for 12 weeks. Some anthropometric measurements (BMI, Lee index and adiposity index), biochemical parameters such as glucose hemostasis parameters (glucose, Insulin, HOMA-IR and GLP-1), lipids profile (TAGs, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, free fatty acids, Apo-B and Apo A1), adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), some inflammatory markers (TNF-Î± and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers (PCC, NO and MDA), some anti-oxidant markers (GSH, CAT and TAOC) as well as, the gene expression level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase were determined. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The results revealed that feeding rats with HF-HFD for 12 weeks significantly increased anthropometric measurements, some inflammatory markers and oxidative stress markers and worsen glucose hemostasis parameters, lipids profile, adipokines and endothelial function as compared to the normal group. Moreover, co-administration of the tested plant's extracts at the tested dose to HF-HFD fed rats reduced the development of indicators of metabolic syndrome when compared to the metabolic syndrome group. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The administered plant leaves water extracts at the tested dose could improve the features of metabolic syndrome. Rosemary leaves water extract has more effect in comparison with the other extracts.",
