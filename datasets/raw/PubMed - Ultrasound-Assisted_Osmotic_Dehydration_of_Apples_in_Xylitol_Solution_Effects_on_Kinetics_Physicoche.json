  "abstract": "In the present study, the effects of varying ultrasound treatment durations (5, 15, 30, and 45 min) applied prior to osmotic dehydration in xylitol solutions on apple tissues were investigated. The efficiency of the osmotic dehydration process was assessed by analyzing its kinetic parameters. In selected samples of osmotically dehydrated fruits, physicochemical properties were evaluated, including dry matter content, total acidity, pH, sugar profile, color attributes, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity (measured by DPPH and ABTS assays), and vitamin C content. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the relationships among the measured variables and to identify underlying patterns within the dataset. Osmotic dehydration in xylitol significantly modified the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of apples, promoting substantial water loss and partial replacement of natural sugars with xylitol. The results showed that ultrasound pretreatment markedly influenced these effects, with treatment duration playing a critical role. Shorter ultrasound applications (15-30 min) enhanced xylitol uptake while better preserving antioxidant activity and color, whereas longer ultrasound treatments (45 min) achieved greater mass transfer but led to higher losses of bioactive compounds compared to untreated samples.",
