  "title": "Beyond Color Extraction: How Pulsed Electric Fields and Sulfites Affect Phenolic and Volatile Compounds of Primitivo Red Wine.",
  "abstract": "The different impact and interaction of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment and sulfite addition on the color, phenolic compounds, volatile profile, and sensory properties of a Primitivo wine were studied at bottling and after six months of storage. The results show that PEF treatment, promoting the electroporation of grape skin cells and the permeability of cell membranes, accelerated the extraction of anthocyanins and polyphenols only in the initial phase of maceration. After six months in bottles, wines treated only with PEF show lower levels of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonols, but a significant increase in procyanidins B2, which are important for structure and color stability and a richer flavor profile, with higher concentrations of fruity esters and higher alcohols. The use of SO2improves anthocyanin stabilization and facilitates the extraction of polyphenols. The wines from the PEF + SO2combination maintain greater aromatic freshness, limiting the formation of oxidative compounds. Wines made from SO2have a more balanced profile, with cherry, plum, and licorice aromas, although the combined PEF + SO2treatment better preserves fresh fruit aromas, reducing the perception of dried fruits and herbaceous notes.",
