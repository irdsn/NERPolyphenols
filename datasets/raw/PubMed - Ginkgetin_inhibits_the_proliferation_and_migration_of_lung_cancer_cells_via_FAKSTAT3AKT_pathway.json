  "abstract": "Lung cancer has become a primary illness that severely endangers human life and health due to its extremely high morbidity and mortality rates. Ginkgetin has been proven to have toxic effects on various tumor cells. Nevertheless, the mechanism of Ginkgetin on lung cancer is uncertain. In the present study, the effect and possible mechanism of Ginkgetin on lung cancer were explored.",
