  "abstract": "Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have emerged as the most widely synthesized metal nanoparticles in sustainable chemistry due to their unique magnetic properties, excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity. In this study, IONPs are successfully synthesized via a rapid, sustainable, and environmentally friendly green synthesis approach using Cannabis sativa L. leaf extract. X-ray diffraction analysis determined that the synthesized NPs had an average particle size of 18.8 nm, while transmission electron microscopy images reveal a spherical morphology with sizes ranging from 12 to 21 nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids, which are believed to play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of IONPs. Its photocatalytic potential is demonstrated through the degradation of bromophenol blue dye. Additionally, the NPs exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against various microbial species, along with promising anticancer effects on cancer cell lines. In conclusion, this study provides a promising foundation for advancing the large-scale, commercial production of IONPs through green synthesis methods. By offering an eco-friendly and efficient alternative to conventional nanoparticle synthesis, the findings contribute significantly to the growing body of research in sustainable nanotechnology.",
