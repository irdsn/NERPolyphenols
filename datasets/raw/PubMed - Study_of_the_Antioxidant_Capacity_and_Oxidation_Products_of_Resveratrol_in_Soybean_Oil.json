  "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring polyphenol that is widely utilized in functional food due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-aging properties. In the present study, the antioxidant capacity and oxidation products of resveratrol in soybean oil were investigated. The antioxidant activity of resveratrol was evaluated by employing various in vitro antioxidant assays such as DPPH scavenging activities, ferric reducing abilities (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Furthermore, monitoring the peroxide value and the acid value of soybean oil with the addition of 200-1000 μg/g of resveratrol at 60 and 180 °C. It was found that when the concentration of resveratrol in soybean oil was 600 µg/g, the antioxidant capacity was most effective. Resveratrol and its thermal degradation products were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). There were seven nonvolatile oxidation products with mass-to-charge ratios of 138.03, 171.04, 185.10, 157.03, 436.13, 244.07 and 306.09 kg/C and two volatile oxidation products with mass-to-charge ratios of 100.05 and 158.13 kg/C were identified. The research findings may provide essential information for the development of resveratrol as functional oils in future.",
