  "abstract": "Cocoa bean shell (CBS) is a by-product with aromatic characteristics that can enhance the aroma and bioactivity of herbal infusions. This study was aimed to determine the effect of the addition of cocoa bean shell on the metabolite profile and antioxidant activity of infusions made withIlex guayusaandVernonanthura patensand their mixtures. Metabolite profile was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis. Total polyphenol content and flavonoids were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and by the flavonoid-AlCl3 complex, respectively. Antioxidant activities were measured by the decolorization assay of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical and the ferric reducing antioxidant power. The results revealed that the addition of CBS increases the content of phenolic acids in the infusions (caffeic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and pyrocatechol). Nonetheless, the antioxidant activity of the infusions decreased with the addition of CBS (16.21 to 2.74 TEAC). Carboxylic acids and derivatives, major compounds present in the infusions prepared withV. patens, were the metabolites that showed the highest correlation with the antioxidant activity. This study suggests that the infusions made with CBS present a profile of metabolites different from the infusions ofI. guayusa,V. patens, and their mixtures.",
