  "title": "Effects of Resveratrol Derivatives on Melanogenesis and Antioxidant Activity in B16F10 Cells.",
  "abstract": "Excessive melanogenesis causes abnormal pigmentation and a higher risk of skin disorders (e.g., melanoma). Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, exerts antioxidant and anti-aging effects. However, the effects of RSV and its derivatives on melanogenesis remain unclear. This study investigated their effects on melanogenesis and antioxidant activity in B16F10 cells. After measuring cell viability, B16F10 cells were incubated with 50 µM of RSV, dihydroresveratrol (DIRSV), and other RSV derivatives for 24 h. The relative melanin content and tyrosinase activity were quantified. The protein and mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (MITF, CREB, TYR, and TRP) and the binding affinity of RSV derivatives to their target proteins were measured. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using ABTS and DPPH assays. RSV and DIRSV (50 µM) significantly reduced melanin content and tyrosinase activity, respectively. However, other derivatives had no significant effects. RSV, DIRSV, and other derivatives significantly suppressed MITF and CREB levels. Additionally, DIRSV significantly reduced p-CREB and TYR protein levels and showed a higher affinity for CREB than RSV, despite no significant changes inMITF,TYR, orTRPmRNA levels. In the antioxidant assays, RSV and DIRSV exhibited significant ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities. DIRSV, like RSV, inhibits melanogenesis and exhibits antioxidant effects in B16F10 cells. However, RSV derivatives demonstrate partial antioxidant activity and inhibit melanogenesis-related proteins but do not significantly affect melanogenesis. DIRSV's practical applications as a skin-protective and -whitening agent warrant further exploration.",
