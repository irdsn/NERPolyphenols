  "title": "Mucoadhesive PVA Film for Sustained Resveratrol Delivery: Formulation, Characterization, and Release Profile.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to develop and optimize polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based polymeric films containing resveratrol (RSV) and to evaluate their applicability as oral mucosal wound dressings. Given the dynamic and complex nature of the oral environment, physicochemical parameters such as elasticity, mucoadhesive strength, and the release profile of the RSV were systematically investigated. The therapeutic performance of pure resveratrol was compared with that of an extract derived fromReynoutria japonica. Films were fabricated using a solvent casting method and characterized in terms of thickness uniformity, weight, color consistency, and flexibility, all of which met the required pharmaceutical criteria. Two tested formulations, FR2 (RSV/PVA/PVP/MCA15C/NaCMC/W/PGE), FE2 (extract/PVA/PVP/MCA15C/NaCMC/W/PGE), showed the best mucoadhesive properties (261.11 ± 0.5 g for FR2 and 299.43 ± 0.38 g for FE2) and a favorable release profile both in water (72.42% for FR2, 77.23% for FE2) and in saliva (49.74% for FR2, 49.70% for FE2). Moreover, the optimized films are characterized by hydrophilicity (contact angle < 90°) and the pH value of the extract after their blurring is close to physiological, which promotes better tolerance and reduces the risk of irritation. Obtained results for polymeric films with resveratrol andR. japonicaextract confirmed their great potential for use in dentistry as modern, mucoadhesive dressings, improving the effectiveness of local therapies.",
