  "abstract": "Product development must be continuously done by the chocolate industry to face a high level of competitiveness in the market industry. This study investigates the effect of powdered sappan wood and butterfly pea flower incorporation in milk and white chocolate compounds. Four concentrations of each additional ingredient were used (0, 5, 10 and 15%). The results show that incorporating powdered sappan wood and butterfly pea flower significantly improved the total phenolic and flavonoid content and antioxidant activity of milk and white compounds. This study clearly shows that the selected plant could be an alternative to improve the health-promoting properties of milk and white chocolate compounds. However, supplementation also has some drawbacks, particularly in increasing the moisture content and the degree of colour difference between the milk and white compounds containing additional ingredients and the control. Also, powdered sappan wood and butterfly pea flower caused a higher viscosity of milk and white chocolate compounds. The results obtained in this study create a new strategy for using sappan wood and butterfly pea flower in various food products.",
