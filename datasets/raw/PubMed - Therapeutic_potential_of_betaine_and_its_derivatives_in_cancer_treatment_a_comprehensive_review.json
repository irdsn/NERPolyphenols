  "title": "Therapeutic potential of betaine and its derivatives in cancer treatment: a comprehensive review.",
  "abstract": "Bioactive natural compounds and their analogues play a significant role in the treatment of fatal diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, hepatic disorders, heart diseases and various types of cancer. Existing chemoprotective treatments for different types of cancer employ numerous natural compounds from medicinal plant extracts, fruits, vegetables, herbs, microorganisms and marine life. One of these bioactive compounds is betaine, which is a natural constituent with remarkable antioxidant and anticancer properties. The betaine scaffold and its derivatives have demonstrated suppressive effects on the progression, metastasis and angiogenesis of cancer cells. Although multiple studies have reported that betaine and its derivatives demonstrate remarkable efficiency in treating cancer or preventing tumor growth, a review summarizing the literature on this important anticancer agent is lacking to date. Thus, the present review article provides a detailed overview of the reported literature on the use of betaine and its derivatives in the prevention of different types of cancers and discusses the inhibitory activities of betaine against various types of tumorigenesis and its mechanism of action. The synergistic effects of betaine with phytochemicals and nanostructure-based medication delivery systems and its molecular modification for lowering the risk of cancer in humans are also discussed in detail.",
