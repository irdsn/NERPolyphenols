  "abstract": "Alcoholic liver injury (ALI) represents a major international public health concern with no targeted pharmacological intervention and a dearth of clinical trial-approved medications for its management. The dried leaves of Schisandra chinensis (SCL) are rich in flavonoids, lignans, polysaccharides, and other active ingredients with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumour activities and are commonly applied in the treatment of osteoarthritis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. The crude lignans of SCL have been reported to treat CCl4-induced acute liver injury, and SCL tea has also been reported to have hepatoprotective effects. The components of SCL are currently the focus of investigation; however, conclusive pharmacological studies on SCL in the treatment of ethanol-induced ALI are rare.",
