  "title": "Bleomycin-Induced Damage in Rat Lung: Protective Effect of Grape Seed and Skin Extract.",
  "abstract": "Bleomycin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent with main side effects including lung fibrosis which limited its clinical use. The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect of grape seed and skin extract (GSSE) against bleomycin-induced oxidative damage and inflammation in rat lung, by assessing respiratory index (RI), oxidative and nitrosative stress (SOD and XO activity, NO), fibrotic mediators (hydroxyproline and collagen), apoptosis (cytochrome C and LDH), inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1), and histological disturbances.",
