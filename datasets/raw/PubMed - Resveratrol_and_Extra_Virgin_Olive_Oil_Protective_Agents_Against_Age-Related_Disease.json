  "title": "Resveratrol and Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Protective Agents Against Age-Related Disease.",
  "abstract": "Resveratrol and extra virgin olive oil are both recognized for their potential protective effects against age-related diseases. This overview highlights their mechanisms of action, health benefits, and the scientific evidence supporting their roles in promoting longevity and cognitive health. A literature search was conducted. Important findings related to the health benefits, mechanisms of action, and clinical implications of resveratrol and EVOO were summarized. Both resveratrol and EVOO have complementary mechanisms that may enhance their anti-aging effects. Resveratrol and EVOO are promising age-related disease-protective agents. Their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties contribute to improved health outcomes and longevity. Incorporating these compounds into a balanced diet may offer significant benefits for aging populations, supporting cognitive health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Continued research is essential to fully understand their mechanisms and optimize their use in clinical settings. Future research should focus on investigating the synergistic effects of resveratrol and EVOO when consumed together, as they may enhance each other's bioavailability and efficacy in promoting health; conducting extensive clinical trials to confirm the long-term benefits of these compounds in various populations, particularly in aging individuals; further exploring the molecular pathways through which resveratrol and EVOO exert their effects, including their interactions with gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.",
