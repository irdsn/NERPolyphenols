  "title": "Pineapple by-products: A critical review of their bioactive compounds as eco-friendly pesticides in pest management.",
  "abstract": "Pineapple processing generates significant waste in the form of peels, leaves, crowns, stems, and cores. Although their bioactive compounds have been explored, a literature review on their pesticidal properties is lacking. This paper reviews the research on the bioactive compounds in the byproducts (peels, leaves, stem, crown and core) in the last 5Â years to give the recent knowledge on the bioactive compounds of the pineapple byproducts as ecofriendly pesticides in food storage management, examining their efficacy against common pests, mechanisms of action, and potential applications while considering human health safety and environmental impact. Among the bioactives identified in the pineapple waste are phenolic, terpenes, and organic acids. Studies have highlighted the pesticidal properties of extracts from waste against various food storage pests. They disrupt pest physiology, inhibit growth, and have antimicrobial activity. Despite these studies over the last five years, there are various opportunities to research the bioactive compounds present in pineapple waste, which could drive its commercialization and utilization.",
