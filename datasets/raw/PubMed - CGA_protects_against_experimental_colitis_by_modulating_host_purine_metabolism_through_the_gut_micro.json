  "abstract": "Alterations in the gut microbiota may contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a product of the esterification of caffeic acid and quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet and has potential beneficial effects on gut function. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the pharmacological effects of CGA on colitis and the potential underlying mechanisms were investigated.",
