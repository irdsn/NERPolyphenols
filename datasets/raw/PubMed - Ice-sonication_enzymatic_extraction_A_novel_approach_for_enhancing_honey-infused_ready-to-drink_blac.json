  "abstract": "This study introduces ice-sonication enzymatic extraction as a novel method for preparing honey-infused ready-to-drink (RTD) black tea, optimizing bioactive compound extraction and sensory appeal. The impact of ice addition (20-60 % replacement of water) and sonication time (10-60 min) on physicochemical properties, bioactive content, tea cream formation, and sensory attributes was investigated. The optimized method (40 % ice, 40-minute sonication) achieved superior yields: 46.24 % water extractability, 209.83 µg GAE/100 mL total phenolics, 78.86 mM TE/100 mL antioxidant capacity, 30.30 µg CAE/100 mL caffeine, 122.40 µg TAE/100 mL tannins, 0.89 % theaflavins, and 8.40 % thearubigins. Compared to conventional methods, the optimized approach significantly enhanced extraction efficiency, minimized undesirable tea cream formation, and improved clarity. Incorporating various honey types (Mustard, Forest, Sidr, Acacia, Eucalyptus, Multiflora, Tulsi) at 12 °Brix demonstrated significant influences on the tea's physicochemical and sensory profiles. Among these, Sidr honey-infused tea exhibited the highest phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and sensory preference. This innovative extraction method offers a sustainable and effective approach for developing RTD beverages with enhanced bioactive content, improved stability, and consumer appeal.",
