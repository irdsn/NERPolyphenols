  "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a pivotal role in oncogenesis, mediating key signaling pathways that drive tumor progression and therapy resistance. In this study, we employed an integrated computational approach combining comparative transcriptomics and structure-based drug discovery to identify differentially expressed GPCRs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our multi-cohort analysis, integrating glioblastoma (GBM) patient datasets from diverse populations revealed consistent overexpression of Frizzled-7 (FZD7) across all cohorts. This finding aligns with comparative transcriptomic profiling of GBM tumor grades, further underscoring FZD7's role as a conserved oncogenic driver. Given the absence of FDA-approved therapeutics targeting the FZD7 oncoprotein, we pursued a structure-based drug discovery strategy to identify natural inhibitors. To achieve this, we performed high-throughput virtual screening of 10,000 phytochemicals against FZD7-CRD domain, followed by molecular docking to prioritize candidates based on binding affinity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were subsequently employed to evaluate ligand-binding stability, conformational dynamics, and receptor-ligand interaction patterns. Among the screened compounds, Cycloartobiloxanthone emerged as the most promising candidate, exhibiting high binding affinity, stable interactions, and minimal conformational fluctuations. Binding free energy calculations (MMPBSA = -65.2 ± 3.8 kcal/mol) and free energy landscape (FEL) analysis further validated its strong inhibitory potential. Cycloartobiloxanthone, a bioactive flavonoid with favorable ADMET properties and lipid bilayer delivery, emerged as a prioritized candidate. Its preclinical efficacy in other malignancies (e.g., lung cancer), coupled with a mitochondrial apoptosis mechanism akin to cisplatin, but with enhanced safety as a natural compound, supports its repurposing potential for FZD7-targeted GBM therapy.",
