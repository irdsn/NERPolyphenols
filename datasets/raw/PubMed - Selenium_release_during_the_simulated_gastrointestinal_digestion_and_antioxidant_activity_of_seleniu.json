  "abstract": "In the study, Grifola frondosa polysaccharides (GFPs) and gallic acid (GA) were utilized to synthesize selenium nanoparticles (GFPs-GA-SeNPs) through a redox reaction involving sodium selenite and ascorbic acid. The morphological changes of GFPs-GA-SeNPs and their antioxidant activities during simulated gastrointestinal digestion were investigated. The results revealed that the antioxidant capacity of GFPs-GA-SeNPs was significantly enhanced compared to SeNPs and GFPs-SeNPs, with IC₅₀ values for scavenging DPPH, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical of 0.45, 0.55, and 0.63 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, GFPs-GA-SeNPs showed a two-stage release pattern in in vitro digestion and had a stronger selenium release capacity. At the cellular level, oxidative stress and apoptosis were aggravated in the model group compared with the control group. Interestingly, compared with SeNPs and GFPs-SeNPs, GFPs-GA-SeNPs can more effectively restore mitochondrial membrane potential, reduce ROS levels, and improve apoptosis. Besides, GFPs-GA-SeNPs can up-regulate the expression of Nrf2 protein (p < 0.05) which can induce the expression of HO-1, SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, decrease the MDA content. Moreover, GFPs-GA-SeNPs can downregulate NF-κB protein, which can decrease the expression of TNF-α and increase the expression of IL-10. GFPs-GA-SeNPs demonstrated exceptional antioxidant activity and could benefit various industries, including food and health products, and have enormous potential application values.",
