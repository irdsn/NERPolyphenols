  "abstract": "Secondary lymphedema (SLE) is a chronic and debilitating condition that frequently arises following cancer treatments, particularly in breast cancer patients. Despite its increasing global prevalence and impact on patients' quality of life, there remains no effective pharmacological treatment for SLE. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), a compound known for treating venous insufficiency, is hypothesized to enhance lymphatic function and may offer therapeutic value for managing SLE. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of GSPE in a rat model of secondary lymphedema.",
