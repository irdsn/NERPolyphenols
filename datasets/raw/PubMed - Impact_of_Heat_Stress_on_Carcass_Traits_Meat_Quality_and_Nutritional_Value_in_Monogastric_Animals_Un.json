  "abstract": "This review examines the impact of heat stress (HS) on carcass traits, meat quality, and nutritional composition in monogastric animals, specifically poultry and swine, and evaluates targeted nutritional strategies for mitigation. With rising global temperatures and intensified heat waves, HS has emerged as a key threat to animal welfare, production efficiency, and meat quality. Physiological disturbances induced by HS, including oxidative stress, protein denaturation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hormonal imbalances, contribute to reduced carcass yield, muscle degradation, and inferior sensory attributes such as tenderness, juiciness, and flavour. HS also diminishes the nutritional value of meat by depleting essential amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and antioxidant micronutrients. This review highlights nutritional interventions, including antioxidant supplementation (e.g., vitamin E, selenium, polyphenols), osmolytes (e.g., betaine, taurine), probiotics, prebiotics, and optimised energy-to-protein ratios, as promising tools to enhance thermotolerance and meat quality. Emerging feed additives such as phytochemicals also show potential for protecting muscle integrity and improving oxidative stability. Given species-specific responses and production system variability, integrating these dietary approaches with stage-specific management is essential for resilience under climate stress. Future research should focus on the precision nutrition, biomarker identification, and validation of synergistic nutritional strategies that safeguard performance and meat quality in monogastric production systems.",
