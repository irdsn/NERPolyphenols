  "abstract": "Aging as a complex process is marked by physiological and functional deterioration, making the individual vulnerable to age-related diseases. Different organs experience unique aging processes that lead to conditions such as cardiovascular, cancer, metabolic, and musculoskeletal disorders. Understanding of these processes is essential to formulate effective interventions. To this end, plant-derived bio-actives are effective antiaging agents due to their specific mechanism of action. Phytochemicals in these plants possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and senolytic activities that qualify them as good candidates for antiaging interventions. These molecules are also reported to act on important aging pathways such as immunomodulation, control of inflammation, reduction of oxidative stress, and senescence. The current review emphasizes the organ-specific mechanisms of aging and the role of certain plant constituents that have shown promising antiaging activity. By overviewing the natural interventions against aging mechanisms, this review provides a foundation for future research focused on using natural antiaging interventions involving phytochemicals.",
