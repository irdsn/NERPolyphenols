  "title": "PVA/HA@BT hydrogel with antioxidant and antibacterial abilities for accelerating diabetic wound healing.",
  "abstract": "Diabetic wound healing is severely hindered by prolonged oxidative stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections. To address this challenge, a dual-network hydrogel (PVA/HA@BT) was developed by integrating baicalein (BCE), a natural antioxidant, and tannic acid-stabilized silver nanoparticles (TA-AgNPs) into a polyvinyl alcohol/hyaluronic acid (PVA/HA) matrix. The hydrogel enables sustained BCE release to neutralize reactive oxygen species and alleviate oxidative damage, while synergistically enhancing antibacterial efficacy through the combined action of BCE and TA-AgNPs. In vitro studies demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, mechanical stability, and the ability to promote endothelial cell migration and tubule formation. In diabetic rat models, PVA/HA@BT significantly accelerated wound closure by reducing oxidative stress, suppressing bacterial growth, and enhancing tissue regeneration. This work provides a multifunctional therapeutic platform that synergizes antioxidant and antibacterial functions, offering a promising strategy for clinical diabetic wound management through the rational integration of natural bioactive components and nanomaterials.",
