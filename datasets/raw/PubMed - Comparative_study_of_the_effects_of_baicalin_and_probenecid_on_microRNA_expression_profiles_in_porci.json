  "abstract": "Glaesserella parasuis elicits severe inflammatory responses and vascular damage, thus resulting in high mortality and morbidity in pigs; consequently, early diagnosis and treatment are critical to controlling economic losses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in vascular endothelial inflammation. Baicalin is an effective Chinese medicinal herb with anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activity. Probenecid has activity toward multiple mammalian biological processes. Herein, we compared the effects of baicalin and probenecid on the miRNA expression profiles of porcine aortic vascular endothelial cells (PAVECs) infected with G. parasuis.",
