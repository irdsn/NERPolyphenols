  "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) accounts for approximately 417,336 cases globally, making it the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Such factors have led to hesitancy in utilizing aggressive treatments or enrolling older patients in clinical trials. Recent molecular studies have identified unique expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs) in endometrial cancer tissue compared to healthy endometrial tissue, highlighting their role in tumorigenesis through pathways that support proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Polyphenols, bioactive compounds found in a variety of plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, tea, and soybeans, have demonstrated diverse physiological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. These compounds influence cellular pathways critical to cancer progression, including apoptosis, immune modulation, and inflammation reduction. Emerging evidence suggests that polyphenols may exert anticancer effects in part by modulating miRNAs involved in carcinogenesis. Specifically, compounds like curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol, and genistein have shown potential in targeting oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs, thereby impacting cellular mechanisms linked to cancer progression. Therefore, this review examines the role of polyphenols in regulating miRNAs within the context of endometrial cancer, focusing on their potential to modulate apoptosis and other cancer hallmarks. By elucidating these mechanisms, this paper aims to contribute to the understanding of polyphenol-mediated miRNA regulation as a promising therapeutic avenue in endometrial cancer management.",
