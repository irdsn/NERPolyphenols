  "abstract": "This work aimed to perform a systematic literature review to summarize and analyze the available information related to the molecular pathways associated with pomegranate (POM) bioactive components to improve molecular markers of cardiometabolic risk. Articles that addressed the mechanistic insights about hypoglycemic, lipid-lowering/atheroprotective, and antiobesity potential from POM were included. Data regarding POM coproduct or by-product, the derivative, bioactive compound or metabolite, the effective dose, model assessed, type of analysis, the organ, cell, or molecular target, the metabolic action, and the proposed mechanism of action were extracted and analyzed. From the results, most of the biofunctional actions exerted by POM juice, leaves, flowers, peel, arils, and other components act through the same initial pathway (PI3K/AKT, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 [SREBP-2], SREBP-1, and AMPAK) and end in the up- or down-regulation of diverse targets, such as insulin release, gluconeogenesis, glucose uptake, glucolipotoxicity, lipid biosynthesis, and metabolism. This could indicate a possible synergistic action of POM bioactive components for treating concomitant alterations. Phytochemicals from POM products have the potential to modulate markers related to noncommunicable diseases. They could be useful for the development of economically sustainable treatments based on functional foods and nutraceuticals.",
