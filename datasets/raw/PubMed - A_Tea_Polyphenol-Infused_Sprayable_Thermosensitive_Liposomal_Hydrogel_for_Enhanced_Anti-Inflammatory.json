  "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease driven not only by intrinsic factors such as immune system dysregulation but also by external factors, including bacterial infections. In contrast to the control of a single pathogenic pathway, combination therapies addressing both the immune and infectious components of psoriasis pathogenesis may offer a more effective strategy for controlling its progression. In this study, we developed a sprayable hydrogel incorporating tea polyphenol-loaded lauric acid liposomes (TP@LA-Lipo gel) to investigate its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial role in psoriasis. Our results demonstrated that TP@LA-Lipo modulated macrophage activity, reduced the expression of iNOS and TNF-Î±, and remodeled the immune microenvironment. Meanwhile, TP@LA-Lipo effectively eliminatedStaphylococcus aureusandEscherichia colithrough membrane disruption, mitigating the provoked inflammatory response. More importantly, TP@LA-Lipo gel, when sprayed onto the psoriasis lesions, provided sustained drug release over three days, enabling deeper penetration through the thickened stratum corneum to reach the inflamed layers beneath. Furthermore, in an imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model, TP@LA-Lipo gel effectively restored the damaged skin, alleviated histopathological changes, and reduced the systemic immune response. In summary, these findings indicate that TP@LA-Lipo gel offers a comprehensive strategy for effective disease management and improving the quality of life for psoriasis patients.",
