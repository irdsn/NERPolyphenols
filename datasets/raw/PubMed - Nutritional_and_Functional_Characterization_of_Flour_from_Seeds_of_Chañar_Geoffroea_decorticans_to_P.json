  "abstract": "Geoffroea decorticans(Gill. ex Hook. & Arn) Burk. is a native tree of the dry areas of Northwestern and Central Argentina. Its seeds are considered waste material. The flour of seeds was analyzed as a source of nutritional and bioactive compounds. It has a low carbohydrate content, containing about 9% protein and between 10 and 14% fat. Approximately 82-84% of the fatty acids were unsaturated (oleic and linoleic acids). A high polyphenol and dietary fiber content was detected. Flavonoids and condensed tannins were the dominant phenolics. Polyphenol-enriched extracts were obtained from seed flour. The HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of these concentrated extracts allowed for the identification of six compounds including C-glycosyl flavones (vitexin and isovitexin), type A procyanidins (dimer and trimer), and epicatequin gallate. Polyphenolic extracts showed antioxidant capacity and were able to inhibit enzymes (α-glucosidase and α-amylase) related to carbohydrate metabolism and (lipoxygenase) pro-inflammatory enzymes and were not toxic. Flour and polyphenolic extract from chañar seeds could be considered as new alternative ingredients for the formulation of functional foods, nutraceuticals, or food supplements. The use of the seed flour in addition to the pulp of the fruit along with the rest of the plant would encourage the propagation of this species resistant to extreme arid environments for commercial and conservation purposes to boost the regional economies of vulnerable areas of South America.",
