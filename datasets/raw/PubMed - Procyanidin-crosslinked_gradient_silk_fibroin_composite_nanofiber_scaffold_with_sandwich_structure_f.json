  "abstract": "Improving the regeneration of the tendon-bone interface (TBI) helps to decrease the risk of rotator cuff retears after repair surgeries. Unfortunately, the lack of inherent healing capacity of the TBI, insufficient mechanical properties, and abnormal and persistent inflammation during repair are the key factors leading to suboptimal healing of the rotator cuff. Therefore, a high-strength rotator cuff repair material capable of regulating the unbalanced immune response and enhancing the regeneration of the TBI is urgently needed. In this study, a novel sandwiched silk fibroin composite nanofiber scaffold with a biomimetic gradient structure was prepared through layer-by-layer continuous electrospinning, and then procyanidin was utilized to further enhance the mechanical properties and biological activities of the scaffold. The physicochemical characterization revealed that the procyanidin-crosslinked sandwiched gradient scaffold (GMPC) possessed an appropriate porosity and pore size and superior mechanical properties. Cytocompatibility assessment and immunofluorescence staining indicated that GMPC allowed rapid adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of osteoblasts. ELISA and macrophage polarization experiments further confirmed that GMPC could effectively inhibit excessive inflammation in injured tissues and regulate the polarization of macrophages to the beneficial phenotype. Therefore, the procyanidin-crosslinked sandwiched gradient nanofiber scaffold might be a promising candidate for rotator cuff repair.",
