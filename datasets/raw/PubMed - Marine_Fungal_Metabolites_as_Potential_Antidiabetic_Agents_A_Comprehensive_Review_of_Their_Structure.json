  "title": "Marine Fungal Metabolites as Potential Antidiabetic Agents: A Comprehensive Review of Their Structures and Enzyme Inhibitory Activities.",
  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus has emerged as a global public health crisis, with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) constituting over 90% of cases. Current treatments are palliative, primarily focusing on blood glucose modulation. This review systematically evaluates 181 bioactive compounds isolated from 66 marine fungal strains for their inhibitory activities against key diabetes-related enzymes, including α-glucosidase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). These compounds, categorized into polyketides, alkaloids, terpenoids, and lignans, exhibit multitarget engagement and nanomolar-to-micromolar potency. The review highlights the potential of marine fungal metabolites as novel antidiabetic agents, emphasizing their structural novelty and diverse mechanisms of action. Future research should focus on overcoming challenges related to yield and extraction, leveraging advanced technologies such as genetic engineering and synthetic biology to enhance drug development.",
