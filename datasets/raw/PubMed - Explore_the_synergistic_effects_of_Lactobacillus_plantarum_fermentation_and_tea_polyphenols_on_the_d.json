  "abstract": "Spray drying often induces off-odors and diminishes the rehydration capacity of egg white powder (EWP), restricting its utility in food applications. In this study, the synergistic effects of the Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation treatment and the tea polyphenols (TP) addition on the flavor variations, protein structure, microstructure, and dispersion properties of EWP were investigated. The flavor results suggested that fermentation and TP reduced undesirable flavor substances (e.g. nonanal, decanal, and 3-methylbutanal), while the interaction between some volatile organic compounds produced by fermentation and protein flavor-binding sites was enhanced. Fermentation unfolded protein structures, increasing binding sites for TP and improving flavor-binding efficiency. Additionally, strong electrostatic repulsion introduced by fermentation improved the dispersion and stability of the EWP system. This approach provides a promising strategy for deodorizing and solubilizing EWP, advancing its potential in food processing.",
