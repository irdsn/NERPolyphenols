  "title": "The Cardioprotective Effect ofMagnolia officinalisand Its Major Bioactive Chemical Constituents.",
  "abstract": "The genusMagnoliahas been found to exhibit different biological properties, including antioxidant, anticancer, and others. For example,Magnolia officinalisis a classical traditional herb used in various Asian countries, especially China, South Korea, and Japan. Magnolia bark is the main medicinal part of this plant. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding theM. officinalisbark and its active constituents, especially magnolol and honokiol, with a special emphasis on their cardioprotective activity in various models. This review paper also sheds new light on the cardioprotective mechanisms of magnolol and honokiol. However, their cardioprotective potential is limited to animal in vivo models and in vitro models. Only a single study has examined the cardiovascular properties ofM. officinalisextract in obese mice. In addition, there is no clinical evidence for the absorption and bioavailability ofM. officinalisextracts and their main bioactive compounds in humans. Moreover, there are no studies simultaneously comparing the activity of magnolol and honokiol. Therefore, there is a need for such studies. There are also no recommendations regarding their effective or safe doses for prophylaxis and the treatment of CVDs.",
