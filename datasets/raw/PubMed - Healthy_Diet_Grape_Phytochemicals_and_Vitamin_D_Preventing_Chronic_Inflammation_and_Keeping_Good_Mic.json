  "abstract": "Since the discovery of penicillin, natural antibiotics have protected humans from malicious microbes. A breakthrough, however, is needed to tackle problems like antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This review introduces one of the new approaches for the prevention of several diseases through a healthy diet, grape phytochemicals, and vitamin D, which nurture the growth of beneficial bacteria, including gut microbiota, suppressing chronic inflammation and up-regulating immunity. Antibiotics provide protection against infectious diseases by preventing the growth of pathogenic microbes. However, inappropriate use of antibiotics increases antimicrobial resistance to bacteria and limits the benefits of antibiotics. In addition, it is well known that antibiotics kill not only pathogenic microbes but also beneficial ones that reside in healthy individuals. As a result, the excess use of antibiotics increases the threat of diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We can reduce the risk of several diseases, including infectious diseases, in the future by nurturing the good microbes that live in the human body, thereby preventing chronic inflammation induced by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-Î±, improving predisposition, and up-regulating immunity. Along with human evolution, residing bacteria in the skin, digestive system, and other areas have changed. They defend their hosts from malicious microbes in the surrounding environment. With the progress of medicine, science, and technology, the quality of life and environmental public health have improved over the years. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to reduce the risk of illness and keep ourselves healthy by nurturing the good resident microbiota in our bodies and preventing chronic inflammation through the diet and the intake of phytochemicals and vitamin D. This new approach is important, along with the traditional method for preventing emerging infectious diseases in the future.",
