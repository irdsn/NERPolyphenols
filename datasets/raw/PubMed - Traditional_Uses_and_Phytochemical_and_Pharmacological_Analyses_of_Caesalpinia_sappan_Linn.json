  "abstract": "The heartwood of Caesalpinia sappan Linn. (Sappan Lignum) has been traditionally utilized as an herbal drug in China for treating several diseases, including osteoporosis and wounds. This review presents a systematic summary of botanical, pharmacological, phytochemical, and pharmacokinetic characteristics; traditional applications; and safety profile of C. sappan to highlight requirements for conducting further studies on this plant and to report its potential uses. We conducted a literature search of relevant articles on C. sappan published in several databases. Additional information was collected from peer-reviewed academic journals, doctoral dissertations, master's theses, and Chinese herbal medicine books. We confirmed plant taxonomy by searching The Plant List database (http://www.theplantlist.org). According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) literature, Sappan Lignum promotes blood circulation by eliminating blood stasis, induces detumescence, and provides pain relief. A total of 127 active components were identified and isolated from C. sappan; these include terpenoids, flavonoids, quinones, phenols, steroids, and alkaloids, showing protective effects against inflammation and carcinogenesis of cardio-cerebrovascular, hepatic, and renal systems. According to recent pharmacological studies, C. sappan has several pharmacological applications for treating cancer, inflammation, and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Most activities of C. sappan could be attributed to flavonoids; however, there is limited information regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms, metabolic activities, structure-function relationships, and toxicology of the bioactive substances of C. sappan. Additional extensive investigations are required to analyze the medicinal properties of C. sappan.",
