  "abstract": "Background/Objectives:Secondary metabolites encompass diverse groups of compounds; one such group is phenolics, which include small phenols up to larger polyphenols such as lignin and tannins. Smaller compounds such as phenolic acids can serve as substrates for soil microbes and enzymes. The specific interaction between plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) and soil enzymes determines whether the products of these reactions contribute to the formation of soil organic matter (SOM) or are degraded into small organic molecules. Methods: Here, we monitored the activity of a redox active soil enzyme, manganese peroxidase (MnP), with three small phenolic compounds. The compounds used in this study were pyrogallol, gallic acid, and benzoic acid.Results:Based on the kinetic parameters determined, pyrogallol and gallic acid are both substrates for MnP with different products and kinetics.Conclusion:Pyrogallol reacts faster and produces a more stable quinone than gallic acid. Benzoic acid is not a substrate for MnP.",
