  "abstract": "Aging and metabolic disorders share intricate molecular pathways, with the Forkhead box O (FOXO)- Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) axis emerging as a pivotal regulator of cellular stress adaptation, metabolic homeostasis, and longevity. This axis integrates nutrient signaling with oxidative stress defence, modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and autophagy to maintain cellular stability. FOXO transcription factors, regulated by SIRT1 deacetylation, enhance antioxidant defence mechanisms, activating genes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, thereby counteracting oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation. Recent evidence highlights the dynamic role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as secondary messengers in redox signaling, influencing FOXO-SIRT1 activity in metabolic adaptation. Additionally, key redox-sensitive regulators such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1Î±) interact with this pathway, orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis and adaptive stress responses. Pharmacological interventions, including alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), resveratrol, curcumin and NAD+precursors, exhibit therapeutic potential by enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing oxidative burden, and restoring metabolic balance. This review synthesizes current advancements in FOXO-SIRT1 regulation, its emerging role in redox homeostasis, and its therapeutic relevance, offering insights into future strategies for combating metabolic dysfunction and aging-related diseases.",
