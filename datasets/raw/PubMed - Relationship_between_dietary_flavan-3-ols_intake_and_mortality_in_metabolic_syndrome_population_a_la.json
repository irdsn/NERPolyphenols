  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a global health concern linked to increased mortality. Diets rich in plant-derived compounds, such as polyphenols, have shown potential health benefits for MetS. Among these, flavan-3-ols, a class of commonly occurring polyphenolic compounds, are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that flavan-3-ols intake is negatively associated with mortality risk in MetS population.",
