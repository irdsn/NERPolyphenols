  "title": "Lactic acid bacterial fermentation as a biotransformation strategy to enhance the bioavailability of phenolic antioxidants in fruits and vegetables: A comprehensive review.",
  "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables (FVs) are rich sources of macro and micro-nutrients crucial for a healthy diet. In addition to these nutrients, FVs also contain fibre and phytochemicals known for their antioxidant properties. Despite the growing evidence of the disease-preventive role of antioxidants in FVs, their bioavailability and bioaccessibility vary significantly and have not been adequately explored. Lactic acid bacterial (LAB) fermentation is considered the most appropriate and accessible biotechnological approach to maintain and enhance the safety, nutritional, sensory and shelf-life properties of perishable foods such as FVs. This review critically assesses how LAB fermentation could be utilised as a promising biotransformation strategy to enhance the bioavailability of antioxidants in FVs. Furthermore, it discusses the potential use of uniquely nutritious Australian native fruits as suitable candidates for LAB fermentation. Further research is essential to identify the beneficial properties of bioactive compounds and effective LAB-based biotransformation strategies to improve the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of antioxidants in FVs.",
