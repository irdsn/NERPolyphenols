  "abstract": "The food packaging industry seeks innovative materials that enhance food preservation while promoting sustainability. This study investigated the development of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) films incorporating both rosemary essential oil (EO) and phenolic compounds extracted from the hydrodistillation wastewater of rosemary. The aqueous extract (AE), rich in rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, luteolin, rosmanol, and carnosic acid, was used to improve the bioactive properties of the films. Four formulations were produced: CMC (control), CMC/EO (with essential oil), CMC/AE (with aqueous extract), and CMC/EO/AE (with both EO and AE). The incorporation of EO and AE increased the film thickness and altered microstructural properties, with EO-containing films exhibiting larger voids due to oil droplet coalescence. Films with AE showed a significantly higher yellowing index and superior UV barrier properties, which could protect light-sensitive foods. FTIR and XRD analyses confirmed successful incorporation of bioactive compounds, while solubility tests revealed that EO-containing films were fully soluble, whereas AE-containing films exhibited reduced solubility (∼50 %), enhancing their potential for moisture-sensitive food applications. EO increased film flexibility, whereas AE-containing films demonstrated improved antioxidant activity, with FRAP and TEAC values approximately 300 % and 700 % higher, respectively, compared to the control. These films have potential for food packaging applications, particularly for lipid-rich foods prone to oxidative degradation (e.g., nuts, dairy, processed meats) and fresh produce susceptible to photodegradation. By utilizing a by-product of the essential oil industry, this study contributes to the development of sustainable and functional food packaging solutions.",
