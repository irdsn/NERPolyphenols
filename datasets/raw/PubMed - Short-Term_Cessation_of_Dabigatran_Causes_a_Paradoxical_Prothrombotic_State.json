  "abstract": "It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short-term (1-3â€‰days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.",
