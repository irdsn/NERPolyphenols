  "title": "Effects of ultrasound-assisted punicalagin binding on the allergenicity reduction of soybean protein 7S.",
  "abstract": "Punicalagin (PUN) is the predominant polyphenol in pomegranate peels, and it has antioxidant property. This study aimed to explore the potential of PUN binding in reducing the allergenicity of soybean protein 7S (a major soy allergen). Ultrasound pretreatment (U7S) was used to enhance the availability of PUN binding sites. After PUN binding, the U7S conformation became more disordered, and the surface hydrophobicity was reduced. The molecular docking results indicated that the formation of the U7S-PUN complexes mainly depended on hydrogen bonding interactions. The phenolic hydroxyl group from PUN endowed U7S with high antioxidant properties, which were retained after digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. At a molar ratio of 1:50, U7S-PUN complexes reduced the IgG binding capacity by approximately 58.05 % and increased the rate of degranulation inhibition to about 35.87 %. This research offers a theoretical foundation for the use of PUN in the production of hypoallergenic plant-based protein products.",
