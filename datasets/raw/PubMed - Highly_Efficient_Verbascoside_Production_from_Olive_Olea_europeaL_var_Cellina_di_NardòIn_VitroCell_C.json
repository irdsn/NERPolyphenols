  "title": "Highly Efficient Verbascoside Production from Olive (Olea europeaL. var. Cellina di Nardò)In VitroCell Cultures.",
  "abstract": "Olive (Olea europeaL.) is one of the oldest and most important fruit tree species cultivated in the Mediterranean region. Various plant tissues, drupes, and olive oil contain several phenolics (including verbascoside, although it is present in the plant at a low level) that are well-known for their highly beneficial effects on human health. Anin vitroolive cell suspension culture (cultivar Cellina di Nardò, \"CdN\") was established, characterized for its growth and morphological features. Furthermore, a vital and relatively uniform population of protoplasts was generated from the olive suspension culture to investigate their cellular characteristics during growth. The polyphenolic extract of theinvitro\"CdN\" olive cells contained almost exclusively verbascoside, as revealed by the UPLC-ESI-MS analysis. The content of verbascoside reached up to 100 mg/g DW, with an average production rate of approximately 50 mg/g DW over one year of culture. This level of production has not been previously reported in a limited number of previous studies. This remarkable production of verbascoside was associated with an exceptionally high antioxidant capacity. The high level of verbascoside production and purity of the extract make this system a promising tool for secondary metabolite production.",
