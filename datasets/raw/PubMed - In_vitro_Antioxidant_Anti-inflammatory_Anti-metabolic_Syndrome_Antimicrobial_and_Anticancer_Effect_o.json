  "abstract": "Lovage seedlings were elicited with jasmonic acid (JA) and yeast extract (YE) to induce the synthesis of biologically active compounds. A simulated digestion process was carried out to determine the potential bioavailability of phenolic acids. Buffer extracts were prepared for comparison. The ability to neutralize ABTS radicals was higher in all samples after the in vitro digestion, compared to that in the buffer extracts. However, the elicitation resulted in a significant increase only in the value of the reduction power of the potentially bioavailable fraction of phenolic acids. The effect of the elicitation on the activity of the potentially bioavailable fraction of phenolic acids towards the enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., ACE, lipase, amylase, and glucosidase, was analyzed as well. The in vitro digestion caused a significant increase in the ability to inhibit the activity of these enzymes; moreover, the inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase was revealed only after the digestion process. The potential anti-inflammatory effect of the analyzed extracts was defined as the ability to inhibit key pro-inflammatory enzymes, i.e., lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 2. The buffer extracts from the YE-elicited lovage inhibited the LOX and COX-2 activity more effectively than the extracts from the control plants. A significant increase in the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties was noted after the simulated digestion.",
