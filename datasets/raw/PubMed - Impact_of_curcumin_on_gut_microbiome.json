  "abstract": "The intricate interplay between natural compounds like curcumin and the gut microbiome has gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential therapeutic implications in various health conditions. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. Understanding how curcumin modulates gut microbiota composition and function is crucial for elucidating its therapeutic mechanisms. This review examines the current literature on the interactions between curcumin and the gut microbiome. A systematic search of relevant databases was conducted to identify studies investigating the effects of curcumin on gut microbial diversity and abundance. Key findings from studies exploring curcumin's efficacy in neurological disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, and metabolic dysfunction are synthesized and discussed. Studies have demonstrated that curcumin supplementation can modulate gut microbiota composition and function, leading to beneficial effects on gut health and homeostasis. Mechanisms underlying curcumin's therapeutic effects include immune modulation, neuroprotection, and inflammation regulation. However, challenges such as poor bioavailability and safety concerns remain significant hurdles to overcome. The interactions between curcumin and the gut microbiome hold promise for therapeutic interventions in a diverse range of health conditions. Further research is needed to optimize curcumin formulations, improve bioavailability, and address safety concerns.",
