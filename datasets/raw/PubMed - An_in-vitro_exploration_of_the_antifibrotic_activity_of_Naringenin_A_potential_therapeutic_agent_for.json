  "abstract": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a precancerous condition primarily associated with betel nut chewing. Naringenin, a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, has been demonstrated to show antifibrotic effects in various fibrosis models. The present study was conducted to investigate the potential antifibrotic properties of naringenin in Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) exposed to arecoline.",
