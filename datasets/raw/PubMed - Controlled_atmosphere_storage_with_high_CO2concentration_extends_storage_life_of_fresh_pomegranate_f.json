  "title": "Controlled atmosphere storage with high CO2concentration extends storage life of fresh pomegranate fruit by regulating antioxidant capacity and respiration metabolism.",
  "abstract": "Pomegranate is susceptible to low temperature. Controlled atmosphere (CA) with high CO2concentration can prolong storage life by affecting fruit quality. Our study probed into the effect of CA storage on the pomegranate fruit quality as well as antioxidant attributes at 5 ℃ for 30 d, plus at 18 ℃ for 9 d in simulate marketing conditions. The atmosphere compositions of 7% O2+ 4% CO2(CA1) and 2% O2+ 5% CO2(CA2) were chosen, the regular air as control (CK).",
