  "abstract": "Mediterranean (Med) dietary pattern consists of moderate or high consumption of foods that are linked to reduced risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS). This comprehensive review evaluates studies on Med diet-representative foods and beverages, such as red wine and olive oil, to understand the inverse associations of Med diet and MetS. The intake of dietary fibre, unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and polyphenols - including flavonoids and stilbenes - help to explain the benefits of Med diet on abdominal adiposity, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, and high blood pressure to some extent. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols as well as the effects of unsaturated fatty acids on lipid metabolism are part of the underlying mechanisms. Overall, this review shows that dietary interventions using Med diet components improve MetS health markers in humans and/or rodents.",
