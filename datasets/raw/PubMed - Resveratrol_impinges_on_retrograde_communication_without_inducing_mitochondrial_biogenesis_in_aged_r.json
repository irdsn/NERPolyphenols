  "abstract": "The natural polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) might counteract the skeletal muscle age-related loss of muscle mass and strength/function partly acting on mitochondria. This work analysed the effects of a six-week administration of RSV (50 mg/kg/day) in the oxidative Soleus (Sol) skeletal muscle of old rats (27 months old). RSV effects on key mitochondrial biogenesis proteins led to un unchanged amount of SIRT1 protein and a marked decrease (60 %) in PGC-1α protein. In addition, Peroxyredoxin 3 (PRXIII) protein decreased by 50 %, which on overall suggested the absence of induction of mitochondrial biogenesis by RSV in old Sol. A novel direct correlation between PGC-1α and PRXIII proteins was demonstrated by correlation analysis in RSV and ad-libitum (AL) rats, supporting the reciprocally coordinated expression of the proteins. RSV supplementation led to an unexpected 50 % increase in the frequency of the oxidized base OH8dG in mtDNA. Furthermore, RSV supplementation induced a 50 % increase in the DRP1 protein of mitochondrial dynamics. In both rat groups an inverse correlation between PGC-1α and the frequency of OH8dG as well as an inverse correlation between PRXIII and the frequency of OH8dG were also found, suggestive of a relationship between oxidative damage to mtDNA and mitochondrial biogenesis activity. Such results may indicate that the antioxidant activity of RSV in aged Sol impinged on the oxidative fiber-specific, ROS-mediated, retrograde communication, thereby affecting the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1α and PRXIII, reducing the compensatory responses to the age-related mitochondrial oxidative stress and decline.",
