  "abstract": "We present a direct mechanocatalytic approach for the Mizoroki-Heck coupling of aryl iodides with olefins using palladium milling balls as catalyst under elevated temperatures in a ball milling reactor. The high chemoselectivity for C(sp2)-I bonds ensures a single product when employing multi-halogenated arenes. Additionally, a one-pot Wittig olefination/Heck cross-coupling enables direct access to stilbene derivatives from aldehydes and aryl iodides without intermediate isolation.",
