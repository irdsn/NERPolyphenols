  "abstract": "The activation of hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs), a critical target of hair loss relief, can be achieved through the upregulation of proliferation, the stimulation of hair inducibility, and the inhibition of cellular senescence. Veratric acid (VA) is a major benzoic acid found in fruits and vegetables. The biological activity of VA on HFDPCs remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the capacity of VA for hair loss mitigation. An MTT assay, Ki67 staining, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and a Western blot analysis were performed to confirm the proliferative effect of VA. Hair inductivity was determined through a cell aggregation assay and ALP staining. Annexin V/PI staining was performed to confirm the anti-apoptotic effect of VA. The inhibitory effect of VA on cellular senescence was confirmed by a β-galactosidase (β-gal) assay and qRT-PCR using replicative senescence and oxidative stress-induced senescence models. As a result, VA dose-dependently upregulated the proliferation of HFDPCs, the expression of growth factors, and β-catenin protein levels. VA also dose-dependently increased ALP activity and cell aggregation and decreased apoptotic cells through the regulation ofBCL2andBAXexpression. Moreover, VA reduced β-gal activity and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in a dose-dependent manner in senescent HFDPCs. These findings suggest that VA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating hair loss by targeting multiple pathways involved in HFDPC activation.",
