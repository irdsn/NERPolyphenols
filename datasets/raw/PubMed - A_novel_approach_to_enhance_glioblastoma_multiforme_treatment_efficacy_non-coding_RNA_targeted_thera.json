  "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor. With the current gold standard chemotherapy treatment, temozolomide (TMZ), many patients do not survive beyond one year. While the urgency of researching novel treatments is understandable, the prohibitively high costs and the prolonged duration of research and clinical trials significantly delay the availability of medical advancements to the general public. This highlights the urgent need for adjuvant therapies to enhance treatment effectiveness.",
