  "abstract": "Effects of postharvest trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) treatment at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 g/L on strawberry fruit phytochemicals, quality and senescence rate during storage at 1 °C for 10 days followed by 24 h at 20 °C were studied. Treated fruit showed significantly lower senescence rate and total acids, and higher firmness (by 15, 18.5, 9.5 %), taste index (by 13, 20 and 9 %), total soluble solids, and overall quality. t-CA, at all studied concentrations, was able to significantly enhance the fruit total antioxidant activity (by 7, 11 and 9 %), total proteins (by 4.3, 3.8 and 4 %), total flavonoids (by 2.5, 5 and 5 %), total phenolics (by 9, 24 and 21 %) and total anthocyanins (by 5, 16 and 7 %) and total amino acids. The increase in different phenolic compounds content, which was negatively correlated with senescence rate, was mostly due to an increase in tyrosine ammonia-lyase activity.",
