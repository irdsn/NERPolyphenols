  "abstract": "Skin wound healing is a dynamic and complex process that involves multiple physiological and cellular events. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSP) have strong anti-oxidation and elimination of oxygen free radicals, and have been shown to significantly promote wound healing, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Studies have indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) acts as an upstream signal to induce mitophagy, suggesting that GSP can regulate mitophagy through the signal pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether GSP regulates mitophagy by down-regulating oxidative stress to promote wound healing. In vivo, GSP treatment accelerated wound healing, granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis in mice. Moreover, GSP down-regulated ROS levels and promoted the expression of antioxidant proteins by up-regulating the expression of p-JNK/FOXO3a protein, thereby regulating the expression of mitophagy-related proteins. In vitro, 4 μg/mL GSP showed no apparent toxic effects on cells and effectively reduce the oxidative stress damage of cells induced by H2O2. Western blot and superoxide anion fluorescence probe further confirmed that GSP effectively reduced Dihydroethidium content and up-regulated the expression of antioxidant proteins by activation of p-JNK/FOXO3a protein expression, thereby regulating mitophagy. Taken together, the findings from in vitro and in vivo experiments provide new insights into the promotion of wound healing by GSP.",
