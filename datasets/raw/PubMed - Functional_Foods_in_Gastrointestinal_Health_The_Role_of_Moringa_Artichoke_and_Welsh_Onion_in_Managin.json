  "abstract": "Diarrhea is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder with significant global health implications, often associated with disruptions in intestinal motility, barrier function, and fluid homeostasis. This study investigates the anti-diarrheal potential of three medicinal plants: Moringa oleifera, Cynara scolymus (artichoke), and Allium fistulosum (Welsh onion) sourced from organic farms in Tunisia, ensuring high-quality, pesticide-free material for experimental investigation in a rat model of castor oil-induced diarrhea.",
