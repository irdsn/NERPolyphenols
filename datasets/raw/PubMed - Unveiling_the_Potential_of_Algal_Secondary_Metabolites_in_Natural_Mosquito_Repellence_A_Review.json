  "title": "Unveiling the Potential of Algal Secondary Metabolites in Natural Mosquito Repellence: A Review.",
  "abstract": "Several catastrophic diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria, dengue, and the Zika virus. Hence, conventional insecticide repellents have become common for controlling the diseases borne by mosquitoes, but the risk of toxicity and environmental pollution leads to the need for naturally derived chemicals. Algae are photosynthetic microorganisms that have diverse structures and produce many varied substances that may have mosquito-repellent activity, including bioactive secondary metabolites. This review focuses on algae's prospects of natural mosquito repellent agents as per compounds identified, functioning and efficiency. Furthermore, we consider the prospects and limitations for obtaining repellents from algae for effective vector control.",
