  "abstract": "The strong binding capacity of proanthocyanidins towards proteins provides a potential for natural modification of ovalbumin (OVA) and eventually altering its functionalities. In this study, polymeric proanthocyanidins from the fruit of Averrhoa carambola (APAs) were prepared and structurally characterized, and then the possibility and underlying mechanisms of enhancing OVA foaming properties via non-covalent binding to APAs were evaluated. Procyanidins consisting predominately of epicatechin units connected by both A- and B-type interflavan bonds were identified as APAs principal components. UV-vis absorption, fluorescence, CD, FT-IR spectroscopy and molecular docking results revealed that APAs could bind to OVA to form the ground-state complexes and thereby quench the intrinsic fluorescence of OVA. The conformation of OVA was changed by its interaction with APAs, and the main binding forces between them were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity, contact angle and surface tension of OVA were declined after complexation with APAs, while the free sulfhydryl content, apparent viscosity and interfacial protein content were increased. The addition of APAs significantly promoted the foaming performance of OVA with an improvement of 15% in foaming capacity and 7% in foam stability. These results suggested that APAs might be applied as foaming additives in food industry.",
