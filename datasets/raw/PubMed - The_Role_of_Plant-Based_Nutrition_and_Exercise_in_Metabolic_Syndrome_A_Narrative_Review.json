  "title": "The Role of Plant-Based Nutrition and Exercise in Metabolic Syndrome: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prevalent health condition characterized by central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle interventions, particularly plant-based nutrition and exercise, are essential for managing MetS. While both strategies are well-documented independently, their synergistic effects remain less explored. This narrative review integrates findings from both domains to evaluate their combined impact on metabolic syndrome. The review examines the individual and combined impacts of plant-based nutrition and exercise on MetS-related metabolic dysfunction.",
