  "abstract": "In this study, the effect of encapsulated raspberry powder (EnRP) as a natural antimicrobial and antioxidant on the quality characteristics and shelf life of ground beef packaged under aerobic storage conditions was investigated. For this purpose, the bioactive compound profile, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of EnRP were determined, and ground beef samples treated with EnRP (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0%) were aerobically packed and stored at 2 ± 0.5 °C for 5 days. Increasing EnRP level decreased (P< 0.01) the pH values of samples, and the lowest values recorded in 3% EnRP treatment (P< 0.05). Lipid oxidation and color values of ground beef were also affected by the addition of EnRP (P< 0.01) and the groups containing 2 and 3% EnRP had the highesta* (redness) and lowest TBARS values (P< 0.05). Lipid oxidation at the end of storage was inhibited by up to 81.24% compared to the control, depending on the EnRP level (P< 0.05). The addition of EnRP also had significant effects on the microbiological quality of meat samples (P< 0.01) and lower counts were found in the samples containing EnRP compared to the control (P< 0.05). These results showed that EnRP can be used to preserve the quality characteristics of ground beef stored under aerobic packaging conditions.",
