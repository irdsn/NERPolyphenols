  "abstract": "The use of organic plastic additives (OPAs) in food packaging has led to their widespread presence in various foodstuffs. These additives, including mainly flame-retardants, bisphenols, UV-stabilizers and plasticizers, are known for their potential hazards and environmental impact. This review aims to comprehensively assess the contamination of food products by OPAs and evaluate their role as vectors of exposure to hazardous chemicals. A review of recent literature was conducted, focusing on studies that report on the presence and concentrations of OPAs in different food categories, including aquatic products, beverages, cereals, dairy products, eggs, oils, fats, meat, poultry, vegetables, fruits and other food categories. The review also examines regional variations in contamination levels and identifies the pollutants. Significant contamination of foodstuffs by OPAs are highlighted, with varying concentrations reported across different regions and food types. Potential sources of contamination include food-packaging materials and environmental pollution. This review also identifies research gaps and proposes future directions to improve the study of OPAs in food, aiming to enhance the reliability and comparability of findings while supporting efforts to mitigate contamination risks.",
