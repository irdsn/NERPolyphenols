  "abstract": "Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton has been widely used to treat respiratory diseases. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex and heterogeneous disease characterized by airway inflammation, pulmonary edema and hypoxia, but still lacks effective medications in clinic. Therefore, in this study, active components from perilla leaf extract (PLE) were identified and their therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms against ALI were further investigated. Using anti-inflammation bioactivity-guided fractionation, a fraction (PLE-A) with the highest anti-inflammatory activity was obtained from PLE, in which, the main components of Rosmarinic Acid (RosA) and Scutellarin (Scu) were identified by LC-MS/MS. And then, the synergistic anti-inflammatory effects of major compounds were screened by SynergyFinder, and confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo, PLE-A, RosA and Scu attenuated LPS-induced ALI, while the compatibility of RosA and Scu showed stronger activity than single compound, as well as in vitro suppressed LPS-induced monocyte/macrophage inflammation. Mechanically, the compatibility of RosA, Scu synergistically inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of Syk, LFA-1 and Mac-1 in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that RosA and Scu, the major compounds from PLE-A, synergistically alleviates airway inflammation of ALI potentially through inhibiting of Syk/β2-integrin pathway. Thus, our study provides a method to rapidly screen anti-ALI components from PLE, and validates their synergistic compatibility ratio, which increases their druggability and application in drug combination therapy against ALI.",
