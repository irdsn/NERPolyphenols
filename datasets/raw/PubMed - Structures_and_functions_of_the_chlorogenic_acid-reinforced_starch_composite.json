  "abstract": "Poor barrier properties have limited the applications of starch film in the fruit preservation field. This work aimed to improve the structures and functions of the starch film using chlorogenic acid (4 %) and homogenization. Increased molecule collisions were promoted by homogenization during film-forming, according to the Microrheology results. This improved hydrogen bonds between CA and starch in the composite, as evidenced by the increased bond energy (from 18.63 to 20.07 kJ/mol) and XRD results. The starch-based composites also showed limited water migration, increased tensile strength (to 385.31 %), reduced water vapor permeability, and excellent UV-blocking rate (reaching 90 %), which were attributed to the increased interactions and compact microstructures in the composite as well as the UV-adsorption capacity of CA. Moreover, the composite displayed high antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (reached 98.91 %), and good strawberry preservation capacity. Overall, the CA-starch composite could be used as functional packaging for fruit preservation.",
