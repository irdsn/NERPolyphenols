  "title": "Do Young Consumers Care about Antioxidant Benefits and Resveratrol and Caffeic Acid Consumption?",
  "abstract": "Resveratrol and caffeic acid are some of the most consumed antioxidants during the day, so their importance as sources and their benefits need to be evaluated and updated. This survey aimed not only to analyze whether young Romanian consumers are informed about the benefits of antioxidants in general, and resveratrol and caffeic acid in particular, but also to observe the degree of nutritional education of these participants. Young consumers know the concept of antioxidants relatively well; they managed to give examples of antioxidants and indicate their effects. The majority of those chosen drink wine and coffee, but many are unaware of their health advantages and antioxidant properties. Students are less familiar with the antioxidant chemicals resveratrol and caffeic acid. It is advised to have a thorough understanding of these significant antioxidants and their nutritional content as they are present in our regular diets, and further studies on different kinds of antioxidants are required to increase the awareness of people concerning their importance in daily life.",
