  "abstract": "Unlocking the hidden power of endophytes reveals a novel pathway for boosting colchicine biosynthesis in Gloriosa superba. Metabolite analysis of endophyte culture filtrates identifies essential precursors i.e., phenyl ethyl alcohol, phenylalanine, trans-cinnamic acid, and benzoic acid participating in colchicine biosynthesis. Bacilli-treated Gloriosa superba plants demonstrated a remarkable increase in plant growth and colchicine content over untreated plants. Moreover, enhanced nutrient uptake (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) further induced the enzymatic activities critical for colchicine biosynthesis genes such as PAL, NMT, CYP450, and OMT. The metagenomic analysis associated with Bacilli-treated G. superba plants further revealed a shift in Bacillus species, and the functional pathway confirmed the upregulation of precursors in colchicine biosynthesis. Our study highlights the significant role of endophytic Bacilli on plant growth, enhanced nutrient uptake, and shifts in the endophytic microbiome to induce colchicine biosynthesis in G. Superba. It offers a detailed understanding of the endophyte's potential for deciphering its role in enhancing growth and active metabolite composition. It provides valuable insights for sustainable agriculture and unlocking new possibilities for pharmaceutical applications.",
