  "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the tooth's supporting tissues, driven by complex interactions between periodontopathogenic bacteria, environmental factors, and the host immune response. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key modulators of inflammatory pathways and are increasingly recognized for their role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Their deregulation in this disease suggests potential therapeutic applications targeting miRNA expression. Natural compounds such as isodrimeninol, derived fromDrimys winteri(Dw), may offer novel approaches to modulate miRNA activity due to their antiinflammatory properties. However, no studies have previously linked this sesquiterpene to miRNA regulation in periodontitis. This study investigates thein vitroeffects of isodrimeninol on six miRNAs (miR-17-3p, miR-21-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-223-3p) associated with periodontitis using two cellular models.",
