  "abstract": "Food marketers desire residue-free fresh grapes although grapes have a short postharvest life. This study was performed to determine the influences of pre- and/or postharvest chitosan (Ch) coatings on postharvest quality of minimally processed (stem-detached) organic 'Crimson Seedless' berries. Berries were sorted as: (a) control (untreated berries); (b) preharvest Ch (dipping the clusters on the vine into 1% Ch 10 days before harvest at 20% soluble solid content (SSC)); (c) postharvest Ch (dipping the stem-detached berries into 1% Ch); and (d) pre + postharvest Ch. Berries were stored in 12 × 15 cm rigid polypropylene cups for up to 42 days at 1.0 ± 0.5 °C.",
