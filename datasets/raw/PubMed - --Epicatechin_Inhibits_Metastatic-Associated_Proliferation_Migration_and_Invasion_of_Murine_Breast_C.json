  "abstract": "Breast cancer, due to its high incidence and mortality, is a public health problem worldwide. Current chemotherapy uses non-specific cytotoxic drugs, which inhibit tumor growth but cause significant adverse effects. (-)-Epicatechin (EC) is part of a large family of biomolecules called flavonoids. It is widely distributed in the plant kingdom; it can be found in green tea, grapes, and cocoa. Several studies in animals and humans have shown that EC induces beneficial effects in the skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular system, reducing risk factors such as arterial hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, damage to skeletal muscle structure, and mitochondrial malfunction by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, with no adverse effects reported. Recently, we reported that EC had an antitumor effect in a murine triple-negative mammary gland tumor model, decreasing tumoral size and volume and increasing survival by 44%. This work aimed to characterize the effects of flavanol EC on proliferation, migration, and metastasis markers of triple-negative murine breast (4T1) cancer cells in culture. We found proliferation diminished and Bax/Bcl2 ratio increased. When the migration of culture cells was evaluated, we observed a significant reduction in migration. Also, the relative expression of the genes associated with metastasis,Cdh1,Mtss1,Pten,Bmrs,Fat1, andSmad4, was increased. In conclusion, these results contribute to understanding molecular mechanisms activated by EC that can inhibit metastatic-associated proliferation, migration, and invasion of murine breast cancer cells.",
