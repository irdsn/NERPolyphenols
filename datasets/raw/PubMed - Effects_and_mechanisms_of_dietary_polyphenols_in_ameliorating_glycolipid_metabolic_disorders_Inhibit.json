  "abstract": "In recent years, the incidence of glycolipid metabolic disorders such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity, and diabetic nephropathy (DN) has increased sharply, posing a significant threat to global public health and economic stability. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed via the Maillard reaction (MR) between the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars and the free amino groups of proteins, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. As such, inhibiting AGEs formation has emerged as a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of glycolipid metabolic diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that dietary polyphenols can inhibit AGEs formation through multiple mechanisms. These compounds are characterized by their safety, low toxicity, wide availability, and ease of access. This review first discusses the effects of AGEs formation, digestion, and absorption on human health, as well as the mechanisms by which AGEs contribute to disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism and the progression of related metabolic diseases. It then provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms by which dietary polyphenols inhibit both endogenous and exogenous AGEs, and summarizes recent findings on their ability to ameliorate glycolipid metabolic disorders through AGEs suppression. Finally, this review highlights the potential of dietary polyphenols as modulators of glycolipid metabolism and outlines future research directions and challenges in this field. It is anticipated that this review will enhance scientific understanding of dietary polyphenols and promote their practical application in the development of novel functional foods.",
