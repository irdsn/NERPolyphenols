  "title": "Resveratrol: A Narrative Review Regarding Its Mechanisms in Mitigating Obesity-Associated Metabolic Disorders.",
  "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring astragalus-like polyphenolic compound with remarkable weight loss properties. However, the mechanism of RSV in treating obesity is unclear. In this narrative review, we explored electronic databases (PubMed) for research articles from 2021 to the present using the keywords \"resveratrol\" and \"obesity\". This article explores the mechanisms involved in the alleviation of obesity-related metabolic disorders by RSV. RSV affects obesity by modulating mitochondrial function, insulin signaling, and gut microbiota, regulating lipid metabolism, inhibiting oxidative stress, and regulating epigenetic regulation. Administering RSV to pregnant animals exhibits maternal and first-generation offspring benefits, and RSV administration to lactating animals has long-term benefits, which involve the epigenetic modulations by RSV. A comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of RSV regulation could help in developing drugs suitable for pregnancy preparation groups, pregnant women, and nursing infants.",
