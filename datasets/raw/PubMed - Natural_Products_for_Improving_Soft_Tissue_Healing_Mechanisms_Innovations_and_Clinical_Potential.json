  "abstract": "Scar development is a notable clinical and aesthetic issue in soft tissue healing, frequently compromising functionality and quality of life. Conventional treatments demonstrate limited efficacy in avoiding fibrosis and facilitating regenerative repair. Nevertheless, natural compounds have surfaced as viable alternatives owing to their biocompatibility, multitarget bioactivity, and historical application in traditional medicine. This review examines the therapeutic potential of plant-derived substances, marine agents, and microbial metabolites in influencing critical stages of wound healing, including inflammation, oxidative stress, fibroblast activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. While these agents have demonstrated beneficial effects in preclinical models, their direct impact on functional or aesthetic clinical outcomes remains under investigation. We propose a hierarchical framework linking molecular mechanisms to clinical endpoints, suggesting that improvements at the cellular and molecular level may eventually support better healing quality. Natural bioactives, especially when integrated into advanced delivery systems such as hydrogels and nanocarriers, show promise for enhancing the regenerative microenvironment. By contextualizing these mechanisms within real-world therapeutic goals, this review highlights both the potential and limitations of natural products in the pursuit of improved soft tissue healing. Further translational research is needed to determine how modulation of these processes may reduce scarring and approach clinically meaningful outcomes.",
