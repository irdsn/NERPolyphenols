  "abstract": "The worldwide rise in food allergies underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their mechanisms and the exploration of proactive strategies using natural bioactives. This paper provides insights into the complex processes of allergic reactions, particularly IgE-mediated allergic responses and the role of Fc epsilon receptor I (FcεRI) signaling in mast cells (MCs) degranulation. Phenolic compounds, widely present in natural foods, commonly consumed, and generally safe, are known for their broad health benefits. Many phenolic compounds have shown the potential to inhibit MC degranulation, although their specific targets may differ. This review highlights their potential as inhibitors of FcεRI-mediated MC degranulation, suggesting that dietary polyphenols may support improved anti-allergic strategies. However, knowledge gaps remain, particularly how ingested polyphenols influence each stage of allergen digestion and the subsequent immune events. These gaps need to be addressed to enable more precise and effective dietary interventions.",
