  "abstract": "To evaluate the fermentation potential of diluted concentrated apple juice (CAJ) and identify suitable strains, seven lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, including Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (TM3-23), Pediococcus acidilactici (G1-14), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (TH4-4), Limosilactobacillus fermentum (LX4-19), Lactobacillus acidophilus (G3-2), Lactobacillus helveticus (G3-4), and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (SJ2-10), were employed for diluted CAJ fermentation. The identification of volatile compounds was conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), while sensory quality of fermented products was evaluated using electronic tongue analysis and sensory evaluation. Results indicated that TM3-23, TH4-4, G1-14, and G3-4 adapted well to diluted CAJ and demonstrated a robust ability to metabolize malic acid, with TM3-23 achieving 8.27 Log CFU/mL. TM3-23 and LX4-19 enhanced the diversity of phenolic compounds. LAB fermentation enhanced the aroma by reducing aldehyde content and increasing the diversity of alcohols and other volatile compounds. Fermentation increased L* values and reduced a* values significantly (p < 0.05). CAJ fermented by TM3-23 received the highest sensory scores for taste (22.67) and flavor (22.48). G1-14 demonstrated significant DPPH radical scavenging activity and FRAP (p < 0.05). A comparison of the physicochemical properties of fresh squeezed apple juice and diluted CAJ after fermentation revealed that diluted CAJ serves as a suitable substrate for LAB fermentation, with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TM3-23 being the dominant strain for the development of fermented apple juice. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using diluted CAJ for fermentation, supporting its high-value application in the food industry.",
