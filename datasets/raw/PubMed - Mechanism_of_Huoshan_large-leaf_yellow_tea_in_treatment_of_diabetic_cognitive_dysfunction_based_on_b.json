  "abstract": "Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is a prevalent complication of diabetes, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Current pharmacological interventions have limited therapeutic efficacy in managing this condition. Huoshan large - leaf yellow tea (HLYT), derived from Camellia sinensis leaves, has demonstrated dual pharmacological properties in both glycemic regulation and cognitive enhancement, suggesting its potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent for DCD.",
