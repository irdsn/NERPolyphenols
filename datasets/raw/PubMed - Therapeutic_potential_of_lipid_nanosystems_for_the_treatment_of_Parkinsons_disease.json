  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain is primarily responsible for the onset of the disease. The major challenge faced in the treatment of PD is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which impedes the delivery of therapeutics to targeted locations. To address this issue, lipid nanosystems have been used for the precise delivery of therapeutic compounds in anti-PD therapy. In this review, we will discuss the application and clinical significance of lipid nanosystem in delivering therapeutic compounds for anti-PD treatment. These medicinal compounds include ropinirole, apomorphine, bromocriptine, astaxanthin, resveratrol, dopamine, glyceryl monooleate, levodopa, N-3,4-bis(pivaloyloxy)- dopamine and fibroblast growth factor, which have significant potential to treat PD in the early stage. This review, in a nutshell, will pave the way for researchers to develop diagnostic and potential therapeutic approaches using nanomedicine to overcome the challenges posed by the BBB in delivering therapeutic compounds for PD.",
