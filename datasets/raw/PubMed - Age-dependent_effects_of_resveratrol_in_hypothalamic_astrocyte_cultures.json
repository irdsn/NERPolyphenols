  "abstract": "The hypothalamus plays critical roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and increasing evidence has highlighted astrocytes orchestrating several of hypothalamic functions. However, it remains unclear how hypothalamic astrocytes participate in neurochemical mechanisms associated with aging process, as well as whether these cells can be a target for antiaging strategies. In this sense, the aim of this study is to evaluate the age-dependent effects of resveratrol, a well-characterized neuroprotective compound, in primary astrocyte cultures derived from the hypothalamus of newborn, adult, and aged rats.",
