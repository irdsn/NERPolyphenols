  "abstract": "Climate extremes and rising energy prices present interconnected global health risks. Technical solutions can be supplemented with biomedical approaches to promote healthy longevity in hot and cold conditions. In summer, reducing basal metabolic rate through mild caloric restriction or CR mimetics, such as resveratrol, can potentially be used to lower body temperature. In winter, activating brown adipose tissue (BAT) for non-shivering thermogenesis and improved metabolic health can help adaptation to colder environments. Catechins found in green tea and in other food could be alternatives to drugs for these purposes. This review examines and discusses the biomedical evidence supporting the use of CR mimetics and BAT activators for health benefits amid increasingly extreme temperatures.",
