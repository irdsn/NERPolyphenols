  "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common and important polygenic endocrine disorders among women of reproductive-aged. Current treatments are mostly used only to control the signs and symptoms of the disease, while not being able to completely prevent complications. Curcumin is one of the active compounds in turmeric, which is commonly used for a wide range of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effect of curcumin supplementation on PCOS. The current systematic review was performed according to the guidelines of the 2015 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statements. We searched ProQuest, PubMed, Google Scholar electronic, Scopus, and Cochrane, Embase, and Science Direct databases and on articles published up until November 2024. All of the animal studies (seven studies) and clinical trials (five studies) included in this systematic review that assessed the effect of curcumin on, reproductive hormones and metabolic risk markers in PCOS were published in English-language journals. Most studies supported the beneficial effects of curcumin on folliculogenesis, ovarian histomorphology, and luteinization processes. The effects of curcumin on decreasing the levels of luteinizing insulin resistance luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)and testosterone, were also reported. Curcumin also improved dyslipidemia, but no significant effect on weight loss has been reported. It is suggested that the effect of curcumin in PCOS is more related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin than to the effects of weight loss. Therefore, this study provides evidence that curcumin can be considered an effective factor in reducing the complications of PCOS. However, due to the low number of human studies in this field, further clinical trials are warranted to verify these outcomes.",
