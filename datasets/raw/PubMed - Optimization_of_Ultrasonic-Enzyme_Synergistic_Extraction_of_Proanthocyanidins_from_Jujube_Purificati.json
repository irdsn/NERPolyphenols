  "abstract": "Proanthocyanidins have received extensive attention due to their high functional value, but their sources are limited. Therefore, this experiment studied the preparation, biological activities, and characterization of proanthocyanidins from Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujubaMill. cv.Muzao) at different periods, aiming to explore a new source of proanthocyanidins and enhance their utilization value. Through ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction, the optimal extraction conditions for PC fromMuzaowere determined, yielding a proanthocyanidin content of 2.01%. Purification using AB-8 macroporous resin increased the proanthocyanidin content by 11 times. The bioactivity results indicated that proanthocyanidins demonstrated significant in vitro antioxidant activity (scavenging rate ≥ 83.4%) and blood glucose-lowering activity (inhibition rate ≥ 84.7%). Both activities decreased with maturity, while the degree of polymerization also exhibited a positive effect. Mass spectrometry identified a total of 102 compounds, with cyanidin-based compounds being the most abundant, comprising 28 species. The comprehensive research results indicate that the oligomeric proanthocyanidins extracted, purified, and isolated fromMuzaoduring the young fruit stage exhibit diverse biological activities and are abundant in content. They can be utilized for the extraction and purification of proanthocyanidins, offering a reference for the expansion of natural sources of proanthocyanidins and the development of functional foods.",
