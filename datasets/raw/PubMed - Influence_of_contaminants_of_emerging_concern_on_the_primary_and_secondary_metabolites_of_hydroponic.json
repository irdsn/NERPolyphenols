  "abstract": "The practical application of treated wastewater for irrigation depends not only on its safety but also on its potential impact on crop quality. This study investigated the effects of 14 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) on the metabolic profile of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown hydroponically. Results showed that compared to the controls, exposure to CECs significantly increased yield (48-154 %) but did not affect the content of sugars, organic acids, carotenoids and polyphenols. However, exposed tomatoes had significantly lower concentrations of specific amino acids, including valine, leucine, aspartic acid and methionine (7-14 %), while fatty acids remained unchanged. Additionally, CECs significantly altered the volatile organic compound profile of tomato fruit. Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to CECs can affect tomato quality. This study is particularly relevant in the context of using CEC-contaminated treated wastewater in hydroponic systems.",
