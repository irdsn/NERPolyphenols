  "abstract": "Extra virgin olive oil is a typical food of the Mediterranean area, obtained by pressingOlea europaeaL. fruits. Its polyphenols have been studied for their antioxidant function and protective action against cancer and chronic kidney disease. In thisin vitrostudy, we tested titrated extracts fromOlea europaeaL. on a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293E) cell line, regarding their pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative capacities, using \" IncuCyteÂ®S3 Live-Cell Analysis System\".",
