  "abstract": "Weeds are a major threat to crop productivity, competing for essential resources and often developing resistance to herbicides, which underscores the need for novel, sustainable control strategies. The valorization of agricultural and forestry underutilized byproducts, such as plant needles, presents a promising opportunity for developing eco-friendly bioherbicides based on allelopathy.",
