  "title": "Self-assembled mogroside v nanomicelle system improves oral bioavailability of the magnolol.",
  "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of Mogroside V (MV), a natural saponin commonly used as a sweetener in food and beverages, as a self-assembled carrier to enhance the oral bioavailability of magnolol (MAG). MAG-MV self-assembled nanomicelles (SAM) were successfully synthesized using an ultrasonic dispersion method to encapsulate MAG. The critical micelle concentration of MV was determined to be 2.64 mg/mL. The resulting MAG-MV SAM exhibited a particle size of 175.47 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of 89.39 %. Furthermore, MAG-MV SAM demonstrated excellent biosafety and significantly increased the apparent permeability coefficient across a Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a 243 % improvement in the bioavailability of MAG compared to its free form, indicating enhanced intestinal absorption and sustained-release properties. These results suggest that MV is a promising carrier for hydrophobic substances, providing a viable strategy for improving the physicochemical properties of MAG in food applications.",
