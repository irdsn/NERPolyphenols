  "title": "Insights into tobacco leaf quality deterioration under long-term storage by investigating dynamic phytochemical and metabolite profile variations.",
  "abstract": "Storage conditions affect the metabolome composition and quality of tobacco leaf and, therefore, its economic value. The present study was designed to reveal tobacco leaves' dynamic phytochemical and metabolite profile changes under three different storage conditions: natural (NT), mechanical (MC), and air-conditioning (AC). The 210,003 grade (Hubei Central Tobacco) was selected as the experimental material, and the changes in iodine value absorbance (IV), pH, polyphenols, plastid pigments, conventional chemical compositions, and metabolite profile were analyzed at different times (T0, starting day; T1, three months; T2, five months; and T3, nine months) during storage.",
