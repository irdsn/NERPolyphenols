  "abstract": "Five previously undescribed (1-5) and seven known flavonol glycosides were isolated from the aerial parts of Atriplex halimus L. Their chemical structure was elucidated based on NMR spectroscopy and high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) data. All isolates were evaluated for their antioxidant potential by means of ABTS test and the most active compounds were selected for further in vitro testing by sodium arsenite oxidative stress assay. Significant antioxidant activity was observed for compound 1 that resulted able to decrease pERK phosphorylation, suggesting a role for this molecule in modulating the MAPK pathway and protecting against oxidative damage.",
