  "abstract": "Ruminant productivity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains low largely due to helminth infections coupled with undernutrition. To jointly boost ruminant health and nutritional status, rural farmers in SSA often resort to indigenous ethno-nutraceutical plants (iENPs), which form part of folkloric practices perceived to be more accessible, affordable and effective compared with chemotherapy which is challenged by helminth resistance. However, these perceived advantages are largely unsubstantiated.",
