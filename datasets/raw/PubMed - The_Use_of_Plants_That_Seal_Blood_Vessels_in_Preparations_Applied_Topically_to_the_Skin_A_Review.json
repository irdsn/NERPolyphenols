  "abstract": "Plants provide valuable compounds that positively influence the health of blood vessels, including those in the skin. Numerous plants exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilating effects, which enhance blood circulation and may promote skin regeneration and suppleness. Botanical species likeCamellia sinensis,Chrysanthellum indicum,Helichrysum italicum,Glycyrrhiza glabra,Ginkgo biloba, orArtemisia lavandulaefoliamay positively influence the health of cutaneous blood vessels in the skin. The beneficial impact in this context is attributed to various secondary metabolites inherent to these plants, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, vitamins, or saponins, which can subsequently enhance microcirculation, diminish swelling, inhibit telangiectasia, occlude blood vessels, and enhance skin appearance. In addition, the high antioxidant activity of plants is also key here, which helps protect vessels from damage caused by oxidative stress. This article provides an overview of specific plants that may positively influence skin blood vessels, along with a discussion of particular active compounds within these plants that exhibit such effects. These herbs not only improve vascular health but also promote a more youthful appearance. By examining their distinct qualities, we can enhance our comprehension of their synergistic effects on skin vitality and resilience.",
