  "abstract": "The present study investigates the anti-skin-aging properties and bioactive compounds of the aerial parts ofAstragalus membranaceus, which are typically discarded as agricultural waste. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified flavonoid glycosides as the major constituents of the aerial parts ofA.membranaceusextract. Two principal flavonoids, astraflavonoid A (1) and astraside C (2), were isolated using repetitive chromatography. Compounds1and2demonstrated antioxidative properties, reducing reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels in human dermal fibroblasts upon stimulation with TNF-α. Specifically, astraside C (2) inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, whereas astraflavonoid A (1) did not affect their expression. Additionally, the expression of inflammatory mediators such as nuclear factor kappa B and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was increased by1, whereas it was suppressed by2. Furthermore, in silico molecular docking experiments confirmed that compound2effectively binds to COX-2. These findings suggest that the aerial parts ofA.membranaceuscontain bioactive flavonol glycosides with promising anti-skin-aging properties, offering valuable use as agricultural byproducts.",
