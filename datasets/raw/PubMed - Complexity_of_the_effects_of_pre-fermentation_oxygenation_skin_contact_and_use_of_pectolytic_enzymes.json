  "abstract": "Ion exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE followed by identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOF-MS) were used for comprehensive proteomics and volatilomics evaluation of the effects of pre-fermentative oxygenation, skin contact and use of pectolytic enzymes in production of Malvazija istarska white wine, respectively. Many protein species and an unprecedented number of volatiles have been identified and (semi)quantified, revealing high complexity of the observed effects. Compared to a standard control wine, oxygenation treatment modulated the protein composition and resulted with a volatilome characterized by decreased levels of several important volatiles. Skin contact treatments, especially in combination with pectolytic enzymes, significantly increased the levels of a large number of proteins, but were also deprived of particular protein species found in other wines. Wines obtained by skin contact with exogenous enzymes exhibited the most complex volatile composition with increased levels of many key monoterpenoids, alcohols and esters.",
