  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with synovitis as the main pathological change. Previous research has demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome is hyperactivated in RA patients, with its potential mechanism possibly linked to anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). However, there are no RA treatment drugs specifically targeting NLRP3 inflammasome in clinical practice currently.",
