  "title": "Oncolytic bacteria: A revolutionary approach to cancer therapy.",
  "abstract": "Cancer is one of the most devastating diseases all over the globe, and it is the second worldwide cause of death, exceeded only by cardiovascular diseases. The therapeutic approach to human cancer has evolved significantly and has varied depending on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the general health status of the patient. Despite the advancements in cancer treatment, various challenges persist in the treatment of cancer, including side effects, drug resistance, and incomplete eradication of tumors. The use of oncolytic bacteria (cancer targeting and destroying bacteria) has been identified to have several advantages over the traditional methods of cancer treatment. Several bacterial species have been identified to be used in the treatment of different types of cancers. Oncolytic therapy can be achieved through the use of a naturally occurring and/or genetically modified bacterial species, includingClostridium,Salmonella, Escherichia coli,andListeriaspp. with their toxins, enzymes, biofilms, and secondary metabolites as well as their spores that leads to direct or indirect killing of cancer cells. This review provides some highlights about the biology and therapeutic potential of oncolytic bacteria individually or in combination with other therapeutic approaches against different types of cancers. Besides, the current challenges and future perspectives will be explored.",
