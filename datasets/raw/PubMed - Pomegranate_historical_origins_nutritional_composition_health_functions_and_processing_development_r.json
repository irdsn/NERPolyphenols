  "abstract": "Pomegranate, native to Iran and Central Asia, has a long history of cultivation and widespread dissemination through trade. Its extensive geographic distribution highlights its ecological adaptability and economic importance. The fruit contains about 80% water, 12-20% carbohydrates, and 10-60 mg of dietary fiber per 100 g. It is rich in vitamins, including vitamin C, potassium, and folate. Pomegranate also contains bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, triterpenes, and tannins, which contribute to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. The concentration of bioactive compounds varies by genotype and environmental conditions, with Punicalagin ranging from 16.67 to 245.47 mg/g and Ellagic acid between 0.44 and 3.04 mg/g. Genotypic variations significantly influence the bioactive potential. Historically consumed as fresh fruit or juice, pomegranate's by-products, such as peels and leaves, also contain bioactive compounds. Recent research has expanded its applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and high-tech industries, promoting sustainable resource utilization. This review provides an overview of pomegranate's cultivation, composition, bioactive substances, and research advancements for further development.",
