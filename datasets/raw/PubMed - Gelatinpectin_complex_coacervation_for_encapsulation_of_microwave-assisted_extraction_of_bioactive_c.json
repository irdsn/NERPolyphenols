  "abstract": "Selection of an appropriate extraction method and stabilization of anthocyanins are particularly important for their stability. In this study, microwave-assisted extraction using different process times (5-30 min) and power (300-700 W) was applied to recover red onion skin bioactive ingredients. Anthocyanin content, antioxidative capacity, and total phenolic content were strongly influenced by microwave extraction parameters. The extract was encapsulated using a complex coacervation method with different gelatin: pectin ratio and pH values. Maximum turbidity and coacervation yield were obtained at a 1:1 ratio of gelatin-pectin at pH = 3.5, with the zeta potential of gelatin-pectin dispersions varied from -20 to +16 mV. The encapsulation efficiency values ranged from 30 to 80 %. Studying the release of anthocyanins in different food simulants indicated that the release behavior followed Fickian diffusion. These findings suggest that the microwave extraction of anthocyanins from red onion is a suitable method of recovery of these compounds, and coacervation by pectin-gelation biopolymers provides a sustained delivery of the compounds into nutraceutical food.",
