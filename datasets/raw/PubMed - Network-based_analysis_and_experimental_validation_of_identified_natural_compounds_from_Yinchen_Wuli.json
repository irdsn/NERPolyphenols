  "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has garnered attention for its potential in cancer therapy. Yinchen Wuling San (YWLS), a classical herbal formula, has been traditionally used for liver-related conditions, but its bioactive components and molecular mechanisms relevant to hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unclear. This study aims to identify the active compounds and potential molecular targets of Yinchen Wuling San in the context of AML through network pharmacology analysis, and to experimentally validate the effects of selected candidate compounds in AML models.",
