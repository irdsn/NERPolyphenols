  "abstract": "The rhizomes ofBoesenbergia rotunda(fingerroot) and its bioactive compound, panduratin A, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-proliferative properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-melanogenic (including anti-tyrosinase) effects ofB. rotundaextract and panduratin A in B16F10 melanoma cells induced by UVA radiation. The effects of the compounds on fibroblast proliferation and migration were also assessed by scratch wound healing assays in human primary fibroblasts. The results showed thatB. rotundaextract and panduratin A significantly reduced tyrosinase activity and cellular melanogenesis induced by UVA radiation in a dose-dependent manner. The compounds also demonstrated inhibitory effects on fibroblast cell migration and proliferation. These findings suggest thatB. rotundaextract may have potential therapeutic effects on skin hyperpigmentation and fibroproliferative skin disorders.",
