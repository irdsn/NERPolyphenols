  "abstract": "The prevalence of lipid metabolism disorders, including obesity, increases with age in cats and humans. Obesity is a condition characterized by systemic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress caused by excessive visceral fat accumulation. Resveratrol (RSV), a natural plant polyphenol, modulates the expression of anti-inflammatory factors. This study aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on lipid metabolism in both healthy and obese cats and assess its potential as a dietary supplement for improving lipid metabolism disorders in this population.",
