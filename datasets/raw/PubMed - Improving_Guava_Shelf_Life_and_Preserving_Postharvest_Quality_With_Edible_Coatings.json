  "title": "Improving Guava Shelf Life and Preserving Postharvest Quality With Edible Coatings.",
  "abstract": "Guava (Psidium guajavaL.) is a nutrient-dense climacteric fruit, but is prone to rapid postharvest deterioration due to physicochemical changes, leading to substantial quality and economic losses. This study investigated the efficacy of edible coatings-chitosan 2% (CH 2%), cinnamon essential oil 2% (CEO 2%),aloe veragel 30% (AVG 30%), propolis 10% (PR 10%), and gum arabic 10% (GA 10%)-applied individually and in combination (15 total formulations, excluding control) to extend shelf life and maintain postharvest quality. Fruits treated with these coatings were stored under ambient conditions (20°C ± 1°C) and compared to uncoated controls. Results revealed that edible coatings significantly (p≤ 0.05) delayed deteriorative processes, with the CH 2% + GA 10% blend demonstrating optimal performance. Notably, this formulation minimized weight loss (6.31%), retained firmness (4.11 kg/cm2), and preserved color attributes. Additionally, it maintained superior biochemical quality, including titratable acidity (0.322%), ascorbic acid (198.22 mg/100 g), total antioxidants (136.76 mM Trolox/100 g), and phenolic content (177.03 mg GAE/100 g), with extended shelf life up to 12 days. The findings underscore the potential of chitosan-gum arabic composite coatings as a sustainable, natural solution to mitigate postharvest losses in guava, offering actionable strategies for enhancing storability and marketability without reliance on synthetic additives.",
