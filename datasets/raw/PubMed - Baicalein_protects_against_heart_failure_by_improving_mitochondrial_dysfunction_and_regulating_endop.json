  "abstract": "Baicalein, a flavonoid derived from the roots ofScutellaria baicalensis Georgi, demonstrates multifarious pharmacological effects due to its high antioxidant activity. However, the latent mechanisms remain insufficiently resolved. In the present research, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of baicalein on isoprenaline (ISO)-induced heart failure and investigated the possible underlying mechanisms.",
