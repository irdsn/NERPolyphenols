  "abstract": "Opuntia dilleniiis a plant rich in bioactive compounds with various beneficial properties. This study aimed to analyse the chemical profile of its seed oils, phenolic content, and antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Seeds were subjected to oil extraction and gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Total phenolic content was quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, while antioxidant activity was assessed through FRAP and DPPH assays. Phenolic compounds were characterised by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and antibacterial activity was evaluated using diffusion and microdilution methods. GC analysis revealed that linoleic acid (74.34%) was the dominant fatty acid. The total polyphenol content was 109.635 ± 1.66 mg GAE/100 g (powder) and 123.476 ± 8.21 mg GAE/100 g (oilcake). HPLC identified major phenolic compounds such as catechin, caffeic acid, and rutin. A strong correlation was observed between phenolic content and antibacterial and antioxidant activities, highlighting the potential applications ofOpuntia dilleniiextracts.",
