  "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid is a phenolic compound commonly found in the Lamiaceae (Labiateae) plant species. It is considered responsible for a wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities of plants containing this compound. The aim of the current review is to present the fate of rosmarinic acid inside the human body, explained through pharmacokinetic steps and to briefly present the health benefits of RA. Pharmacokinetics was at first studied in animal models, but several studies were conducted in humans as well. This compound can be applied topically, pulmonary, intranasally, andviaintravenous infusion. However, peroral application is the main route of entry into the human body. Presumably, it is mainly metabolized by the gut microflora, providing simple, more easily absorbed phenolic units. Inside the body, the rosmarinic acid molecule undergoes structural changes, as well as conjugation reactions. Renal excretion represents the main path of elimination. Previously conducted studies reported no serious adverse effects of herbal remedies containing RA, as well as their positive effects on human health. In addition toin vitrostudies, clinical investigations suggested its benefits in dermatological, allergic, and osteoarthritic disorders, as well as for improving cognitive performance and in metabolic syndrome treatment. Future studies should investigate the kinetics during long-term application in patients who would have potential benefits from RA usage. Pharmaceutical formulations designed to prevent the fast metabolism of RA and allow its penetration into other compartments of the human body are also interesting topics for future research.",
