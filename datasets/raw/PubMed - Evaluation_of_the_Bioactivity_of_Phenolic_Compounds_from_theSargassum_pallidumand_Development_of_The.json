  "abstract": "Chronic inflammation poses a significant threat to physical health. The increasing prevalence of skin disorders is attributed to external factors such as environmental pollution and UV-induced stress. To address damaged skin, the cosmetic market increasingly favors the development of effective products containing natural active compounds. This study constitutes the initial examination of the anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols extracted fromSargassum pallidum. The experimental results demonstrated that SPP significantly reduced intracellular levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and multiple inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, SPP exhibited an inhibitory effect on the mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes: compared to the control group, the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, and COX-2 decreased by 4.94 ± 0.72-fold, 113.64 ± 27.46-fold, 1.40 ± 0.21-fold, 11.68 ± 3.90-fold, and 0.47 ± 0.11-fold, respectively (data presented as mean ± SD, *p< 0.05). SPP was incorporated into cosmetic formulations as a natural active ingredient to create emulsions and creams. Upon assessment of various skin parameters, these formulations demonstrated significant skincare benefits. In conclusion, SPP exhibits promising anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential natural active ingredient for applications in cosmetics.",
