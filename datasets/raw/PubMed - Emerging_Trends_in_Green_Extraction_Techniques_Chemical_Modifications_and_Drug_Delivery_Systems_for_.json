  "abstract": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin found in red grapes, cocoa berries, and red grape wine. This compound exhibits potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. However, its clinical application is significantly hindered by poor aqueous solubility and rapid degradation at physiological pH, resulting in extremely low systemic bioavailability. This review explores three key aspects: green extraction methods for the efficient and sustainable isolation of resveratrol; structure-activity relationship studies of resveratrol derivatives to identify compounds with improved bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy; and advanced drug delivery systems to enhance resveratrol solubility, stability, and achieve targeted tissue delivery. All of these solutions collectively aim to increase resveratrol bioavailability, enabling the development of effective pharmaceutical formulations and maximizing the clinical potential of this promising compound. The aim of this review is to summarize the key studies published in the last five years, highlighting innovative advancements in sustainable extraction, structural modifications, and delivery strategies for resveratrol.",
