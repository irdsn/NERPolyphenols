  "abstract": "Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips, WFT), a highly destructive polyphagous pest, has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to overcome plant defenses. Salivary effectors play a crucial role in this process. In this study, we investigated the promotion effects of two candidate effectors (Fomyr6 and Foαglu1) previously identified in F. occidentalis salivary glands on the adaptation of F. occidentalis to host plant. First, we determined their subcellular localization, then expressed these proteins in kidney bean plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system. We further analyzed their impact on plant defense responses and the WFT feeding behavior.",
