  "title": "Exploring the therapeutic potential of naturally occurring piceatannol in non-communicable diseases.",
  "abstract": "Piceatannol is a naturally occurring hydroxylated resveratrol analogue that can be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. It has been documented to have a wide range of beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-allergic, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and chemopreventive properties. Piceatannol has significantly higher antioxidant activity than resveratrol. Piceatannol has been shown in preclinical studies to have the ability to inhibit or reduce the growth of cancers in various organs such as the brain, breast, lung, colon, cervical, liver, prostate, and skin. However, the bioavailability of Piceatannol is comparatively lower than resveratrol and other stilbenes. Several approaches have been reported in recent years to enhance its bioavailability and biological activity, and clinical trials are required to validate these findings. This review focuses on several aspects of natural stilbene Piceatannol, its chemistry, and its mechanism of action, and its promising therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of complex human diseases.",
