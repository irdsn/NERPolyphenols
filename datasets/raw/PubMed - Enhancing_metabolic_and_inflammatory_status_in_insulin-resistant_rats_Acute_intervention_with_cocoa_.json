  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia, is closely linked to obesity and low-grade inflammation. Acute cocoa flavanols (CF) intake has demonstrated benefits in vasoreactivity, cognitive functions, and antioxidant enzyme activity. However, the physiological mechanisms of CF concerning glucose uptake, inflammatory mediators, and their interplay with aerobic exercise remain unclear in populations with metabolic diseases.",
