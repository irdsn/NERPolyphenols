  "title": "Methods for Synthesis and Extraction of Resveratrol from Grapevine: Challenges and Advances in Compound Identification and Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Resveratrol is the most important biopotential phytoalexin of the stilbene group (natural polyphenolic secondary metabolites), synthesized naturally by the action of biotic and abiotic factors on the plant. The yield of individual bioactive compounds isolated from grapevine components, products and by-products is directly dependent on the conditions of the synthesis, extraction and identification techniques used. Modern methods of synthesis and extraction, as well as identification techniques, are centred on the use of non-toxic solvents that have the advantages of the realisation of rapid extractions, maintenance of optimal parameters, and low energy consumption; this is a challenge with promising results for various industrial applications. Actionable advances in identifying and analysing stilbenes consist of techniques for coupling synthesis/extraction/identification methods that have proven accurate, reproducible and efficient. The main challenge remains to keep resveratrol compositionally unaltered while increasing its microbiome solubility and stability as a nutraceutical in the food industry.",
