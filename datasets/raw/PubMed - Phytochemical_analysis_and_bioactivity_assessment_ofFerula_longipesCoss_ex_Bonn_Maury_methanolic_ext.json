  "abstract": "This study presents the first analysis of the polyphenolic profile and evaluation of antioxidant and anti-corrosive properties of the methanolic extract fromFerula longipesCoss. ex Bonn. & Maury. Using LC-MS/MS, significant bioactive compounds were identified, notably including quercetin-3-D-xyloside (643.10 mg/g),trans-ferulic acid (632.05 mg/g), quercetin-3-glucoside (425.74 mg/g), and -hyperoside (310.21 mg/g). Total polyphenol content reached 111.94 ± 1.63 µg GAE/mg extract, and total flavonoid content was 47.85 ± 0.077 µg QE/mg extract. Antioxidant activity was assessed using DPPH• radical scavenging, ABTS•+ radical cation scavenging, FRAP, phenanthroline, and SNP assays. Notable IC50values were observed for DPPH• scavenging (247.13 ± 3.76 µg/mL), ABTS•+ scavenging (120.57 ± 2.60 µg/mL), and in the phenanthroline assay (84.07 ± 1.28 µg/mL), although lower efficacy was noted in the FRAP and SNP assays compared to standards (Trolox and ascorbic acid). The extract also demonstrated high anti-corrosive efficiency, achieving inhibition rates of 91.2% for aluminium, 82.7% for steel, and 72.3% for zinc electrodes in 0.5 M HCl. This protection is attributed to the adsorption of phytochemicals onto the metal surfaces, forming a protective interfacial layer. These findings highlight the potential ofF. longipesas a natural source of antioxidants and plant-derived, surface-active corrosion inhibitors for potential industrial applications.",
