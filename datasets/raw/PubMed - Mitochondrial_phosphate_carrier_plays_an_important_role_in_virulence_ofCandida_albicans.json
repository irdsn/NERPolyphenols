  "abstract": "Candida albicansis a common fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections.MIR1is considered to be a mitochondrial phosphate carrier ofC. albicans, while its role in virulence has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found thatmir1Δ/Δmutant exhibited severe virulence defect in both nematode and murine models. Further mechanism studies revealed that themir1Δ/Δmutant grew more slowly than the wild-type strain and showed severe filamentation defects on the hypha-inducing agar media, including YPD + serum, Lee, Spider + glucose, SLAD, SLD, and YPS. Furthermore, the loss ofMIR1resulted in unfermentable carbon utilisation defect, ATP decrease, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation inC. albicans. Antioxidant proanthocyanidins, vitamin E, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) could reduce intracellular ROS levels and partially rescue the filamentation defects of themir1Δ/Δmutant. Accordingly, hypha-specific genes, as well asCEK1andRIM101were down-regulated in themir1Δ/Δmutant, and this down-regulation could be partially rescued by the addition of the antioxidant NAC. Collectively,MIR1plays an important role inC. albicansmitochondrial function, filamentation and virulence, and would be a promising antifungal target.",
