  "abstract": "This study investigates the response of red and green kiwiberry cultivars ('Jumbo', 'Bingo', 'Purpurna Sadowa') to different storage temperatures, as limited research exists on red-fleshed kiwiberry. Basic measurements (firmness, colour) and metabolite analysis were performed on fruit stored at 1 °C and 6 °C. Lower temperatures were confirmed to preserve the physicochemical properties of green kiwiberry, but this may not apply to red kiwiberry. We found that higher storage temperatures did not increase metabolites in green kiwiberry. However, for red kiwiberry, which often has not reached full colour at harvest, higher temperatures are crucial for colour development. These temperatures significantly affect both fruit colour and the levels of metabolites responsible for flavor and attractiveness. Post-harvest storage of red kiwiberry is more complex, requiring careful consideration of factors beyond firmness and sugar content, as fruit colour is equally if not more important for marketability and consumer satisfaction.",
