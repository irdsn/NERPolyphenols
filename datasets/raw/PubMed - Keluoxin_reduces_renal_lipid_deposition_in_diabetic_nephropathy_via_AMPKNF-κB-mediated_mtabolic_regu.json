  "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is often accompanied by dysregulated lipid metabolism, which exacerbates renal injury. Keluoxin (KLX), a therapeutic agent approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China, has demonstrated efficacy in treating DN. However, the mechanisms underlying KLX's beneficial effects, particularly its role in lipid metabolism regulation, remain poorly understood.",
