  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Multiple sclerosis (MS) are progressive neurodegenerative conditions. AD is characterized by neuroinflammation, plaques, tangles, and synaptic loss, while MS involves inflammatory demyelination. Although AD and MS have different pathogenesis, they may share some neurodegenerative mechanisms, so similar therapeutic strategies could potentially be effective for both. Research suggests that natural substances such as carotenoids may be beneficial for neurological disorders. Notably, Astaxanthin (AXT) has demonstrated promising effects as an adjunct therapy.",
