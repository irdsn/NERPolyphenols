  "abstract": "Breast cancer represents a significant worldwide health concern for women. Anthocyanin-rich Punica grantum and Beta vulgaris extracts have shown promising anticancer effects. The network pharmacology predictions are used to recognize the bioactive compounds screening of anthocyanins, along with their molecular pathways and targets implicated in breast cancer. The present work includes molecular docking results, the discovery of three potent compounds that can bind strongly to important breast cancer proteins. In vitro experiments were performed in MDA-MB-231 cells to confirm the cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effects of anthocyanin-rich extracts derived from Punica grantum and Beta vulgaris. Also, in-vitro radiation-sensitive studies were done in Low-dose X-rays which paves a new advancement in enhancing Radiotherapy treatment of breast cancer. Current findings indicate that radiation sensitizers are associated with consolidating the pharmacological structure of anthocyanins and specific molecular pathways. Further aspects of natural radiation modifier development for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy are suggested.",
