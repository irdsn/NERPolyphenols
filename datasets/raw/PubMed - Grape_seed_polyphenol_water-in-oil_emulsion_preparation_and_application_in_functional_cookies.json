  "abstract": "The study aimed to address the characteristics of grape seed polyphenols (GSPs), such as high hydrophilicity and poor stability in fats and oils, as well as the poor digestive properties of traditional cookies due to their high fat content. A GSP delivery system based on water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion technology was innovatively developed, aiming at solving the difficult problem of the limited application of GSPs in high-fat cookie systems. In this study, we explored the potential application of GSPs in functional cookie products by constructing a GSP-tea seed oil stabilized emulsion system.",
