  "abstract": "Modern lifestyle, which is characterized by a high-fat diet, increases the risk of hyperlipidemia, a primary trigger for cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. Excessive fat consumption can trigger hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress, leading to inflammation and liver damage, which contributes to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conventional cholesterol-lowering therapies are often expensive and come with side effects, making herbal alternatives such as kecemcem leaves a promising option. Kecemcem leaves extract contains flavonoids such as quercetin and catechin, which exhibit antioxidant properties, regulate lipid metabolism, and reduce inflammation.",
