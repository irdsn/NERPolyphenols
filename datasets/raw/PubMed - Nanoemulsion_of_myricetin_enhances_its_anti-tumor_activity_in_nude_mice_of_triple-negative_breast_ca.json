  "abstract": "Myricetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid exhibits good anti-cancer properties. However, its practical application is limited due to poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability. To overcome these challenges, a nanoemulsion-based formulation of myricetin was developed and its anti-tumor efficacy was compared with Myricetin alone in TNBC xenografts.",
