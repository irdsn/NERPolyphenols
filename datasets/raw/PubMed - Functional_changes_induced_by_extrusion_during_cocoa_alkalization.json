  "abstract": "Polyphenols, a group of secondary metabolites, have well-known relevant effects on human health. During traditional alkalization, this content dramatically lowers. We aimed to evaluate an alternative alkalization method based on extrusion on cocoa functional characteristics. The results showed that the antioxidant capacity and total phenolic values increased as alkali concentration and temperature did, and these values doubled under less extreme conditions. Comparing the functional properties between extruded and traditionally produced powders revealed that catechin, epicatechin and dimers B1 and B2 contents were 43%, 33%, 54% and 34% lower in the extruded samples, respectively. However, this reduction was partially balanced by increased clovamide content up to 50%. Thus the total phenol content and antioxidant capacity of the extruded samples were statistically above those of the commercial one. Hence extrusion alkalization should be considered a new processing alternative to avoid markedly reducing functional properties.",
