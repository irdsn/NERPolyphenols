  "abstract": "The study analyzed the quality characteristics of roller-milled soybean fractions following germination, roasting, and hydrothermal treatments. Roller milling influenced the distribution of nutrients and antinutrients across fractions. Semolina fractions exhibited high nutritional value, with coarse semolina containing higher ash, protein, fiber, iron, zinc, and phenolic content. As particle size decreased, phytic acid and trypsin inhibitor content reduced while protein digestibility improved. Phytic acid decreased by 33.12 %, 13.38 %, and 15.92 % after germination, roasting, and hydrothermal treatment, respectively. Trypsin inhibitor reduction was highest in hydrothermal (82.68 %), followed by germination (64.77 %) and roasting (61.16 %). These results emphasize the benefits of pre-milling treatments and physical separation in enhancing soybean nutritional quality.",
