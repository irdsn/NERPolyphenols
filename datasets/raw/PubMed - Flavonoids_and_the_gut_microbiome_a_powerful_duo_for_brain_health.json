  "abstract": "Flavonoids, a class of polyphenolic compounds, are widely distributed in plant-based foods and have been recognized for their potential to promote overall health and well-being. Flavonoids in fruits and vegetables offer various beneficial effects such as anti-aging, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Flavonoids have been extensively studied for their neuroprotective properties, which are attributed to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with neural cells. Factors like gut microbiota composition, age, genetics, and diet can impact how well flavonoids are absorbed in the gut. The gut microbiota can enhance the absorption of flavonoids through enzymatic processes, making microbiota composition a key factor influenced by age, genetics, and diet. Flavonoids can modulate the gut microbiota through prebiotic and antimicrobial effects, affecting the production of beneficial microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which play a role in brain function and health. The gut microbiome also modulates the immune system, which is critical for preventing neuroinflammation. Additionally, flavonoids can benefit mental and psychological health by influencing anti-inflammatory signaling pathways in brain cells and increasing the absorption of tyrosine and tryptophan, precursors to neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, adrenaline, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The flavonoid-gut microbiome axis is a complex and multifaceted relationship that has significant implications for neurological health. This review will explore how genetic and environmental factors can impact flavonoid absorption and the positive effects of flavonoids on brain health and the gut microbiota network.",
