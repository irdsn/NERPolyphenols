  "abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic compound with diverse bioactivities, plays a crucial role in plant defense mechanisms and has significant therapeutic potential in human inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. The biosynthesis and accumulation of CGA in plants result from a complex interplay between internal factors (e.g., hormones, enzymes, and genes) and external factors (e.g., microbial interactions, drought, and temperature fluctuations). This review systematically investigates the influence of microbes on internal regulatory factors governing CGA biosynthesis in plants. CGA is synthesized through four distinct metabolic pathways, with hormones, enzymes, and genes as key regulators. Notably, microbes enhance CGA biosynthesis by improving plant nutrient uptake, supplying essential hormones, regulating the expression of related enzymes and genes, and the interaction between bacteria and fungi. In addition, our review summarizes the challenges currently present in the research and proposes a series of innovative strategies. These include in-depth investigations into the molecular mechanisms of microbial regulation of plant gene expression, gene editing, development of microbial inoculants, construction of synthetic microbial communities, and exogenous application of plant hormones.",
