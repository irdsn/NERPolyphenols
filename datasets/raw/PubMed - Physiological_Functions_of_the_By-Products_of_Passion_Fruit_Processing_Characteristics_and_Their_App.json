  "abstract": "The by-products of passion fruit are typically discarded during processing, contributing to resource waste and environmental harm. These residues are rich in dietary fiber and polyphenols, compounds linked to health benefits, including blood sugar regulation, improved lipid profiles, gut microbiome balance, and weight management. Beyond their nutritional value, these by-products possess dual functional roles in food systems: their bioactive components act as natural fortifiers and health-promoting agents. Recent studies indicate they can enhance food quality by improving water retention and texture while serving as prebiotics to promote beneficial gut bacteria growth. This dual functionality supports both food innovation and metabolic health, particularly in reducing post-meal blood sugar spikes. To advance research and industry applications, this review synthesizes recent findings on the nutritional properties of passion fruit by-products and their use in food products such as dairy, pasta, and meat. The analysis aims to guide the sustainable utilization of these underrated resources and expand their role in functional food development.",
