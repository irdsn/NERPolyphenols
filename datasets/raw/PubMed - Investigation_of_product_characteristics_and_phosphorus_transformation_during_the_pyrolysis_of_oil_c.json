  "abstract": "Research on the characteristics of pyrolysis products and the phosphorus conversion mechanisms of oil crop residues is limited. Therefore, rapeseed residue (RR) and camellia oleifera residue (CR) were selected to investigate the influence of temperature on the composition and distribution of pyrolysis products, with poplar wood (PW) used as a comparison. Additionally, the transformation mechanism of phosphorus in RR and CR were studied. Pyrolysis was conducted in a vertical fixed-bed reactor. The composition of gas and bio-oil was analyzed using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The morphology of phosphorus in bio-char was detected using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The increase in temperature promoted the generation of gas products while reducing the yields of bio-char. The bio-char yields of RR and CR exceeded those of PW, while the bio-oil and gas yields were the opposite. The phosphorus in the bio-char of oil crop residues is primarily in the form of organic phosphorus (e.g., C3-PO, C-PO3, and COP). The C-PO3and COP groups in bio-char begin to cleave and form C3-PO and *PO4groups at low temperature (400 °C). As the temperature increases, the C3-PO, C-PO3and COP groups undergo continuous decomposition and conversion into PO4or *PO4.RR bio-oil contains a significant amount of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, which hinders its subsequent utilization. Therefore, it is essential to consider denitrification and quality enhancement treatments. In contrast, CR bio-oil is characterized by a richness in hydrocarbons (C12-C20), indicating its suitability for biodiesel production.",
