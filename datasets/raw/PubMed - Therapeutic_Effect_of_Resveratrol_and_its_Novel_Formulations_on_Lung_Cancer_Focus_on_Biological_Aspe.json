  "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Due to significant advances in therapeutic strategies, patients' survival and life quality have been improved, however there is still an urgent requirement for developing more effective therapeutic methods. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol with numerous biological potentials, has been widely studied. It has shown therapeutic potetial in various diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and cancers through the regulation of key cellular signaling such as apoptosis, as well as molecular pathways such as microRNA modulation. It has been reported that resveratrol acts as an anticancer agent against lung cancerin vivoandin vitro. Resveratrol could combat against lung cancer by modulating various molecular targets and signaling pathways involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autoghagy and also microRNAs expression. Moreover, novel delivery systems and analogs have recently been introduced to promote the anticancer impacts of resveratrol. In this article, we review current evidence on the anticancer effects of resveratrol and its novel formulations in the treatment of lung cancer with a focus on underlying mechanisms.",
