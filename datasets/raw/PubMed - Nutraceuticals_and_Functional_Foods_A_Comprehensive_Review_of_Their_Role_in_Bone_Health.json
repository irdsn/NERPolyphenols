  "title": "Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods: A Comprehensive Review of Their Role in Bone Health.",
  "abstract": "Bone health is the result of a tightly regulated balance between bone modeling and bone remodeling, and alterations of these processes have been observed in several diseases both in adult and pediatric populations. The imbalance in bone remodeling can ultimately lead to osteoporosis, which is most often associated with aging, but contributing factors can already act during the developmental age, when over a third of bone mass is accumulated. The maintenance of an adequate bone mass is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, such as physical activity and diet, and particularly by an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. In addition, it has been claimed that the integration of specific nutraceuticals such as resveratrol, anthocyanins, isoflavones, lycopene, curcumin, lutein, and Î²-carotene and the intake of bioactive compounds from the diet such as honey, tea, dried plums, blueberry, and olive oil can be efficient strategies for bone loss prevention. Nutraceuticals and functional foods are largely used to provide medical or health benefits, but there is an urge to determine which products have adequate clinical evidence and a strong safety profile. The aim of this review is to explore the scientific and clinical evidence of the positive role of nutraceuticals and functional food in bone health, focusing both on molecular mechanisms and on real-world studies.",
