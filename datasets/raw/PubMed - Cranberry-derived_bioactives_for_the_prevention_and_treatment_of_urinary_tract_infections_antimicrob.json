  "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a global health concern, increasingly complicated by antibiotic resistance. Cranberry-derived bioactive compounds, particularly proanthocyanidins (PACs), have emerged as a promising non-antibiotic strategy for UTI prevention. This review examines their efficacy, mechanisms of action, and the evolving research landscape through bibliometric analysis.",
