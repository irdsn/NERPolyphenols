  "abstract": "As a persistent inflammatory dermatological disorder, psoriasis impacts a global population of millions, with existing therapies frequently limited by side effects, high toxicity, and low effectiveness. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of a copper-samarium (Cu-Sm)-based bimetallic nanozyme (CS NPs) with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics for psoriasis therapy. CS NPs imitate natural antioxidant enzymes and efficiently neutralize H2O2,•OH, and O2•-. Characterization investigations have confirmed the nanoparticles' stability, appropriate Sm doping ratio, and catalytic effectiveness. In vitro, CS NPs decrease ROS levels, restrict keratinocyte proliferation, and regulate inflammatory cytokine release through NF-κB pathway inhibition in HaCaT cells activated with IL-17. In vivo, CS NPs ameliorate IMQ-triggered psoriasiform lesions in mouse models through suppression of epidermal acanthosis, immune cell infiltration, and inflammatory marker expression. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Cu-Sm nanozymes to provide biocompatible and effective psoriasis treatment, offering a viable substitute for conventional therapies.",
