  "title": "Dihydromyricetin mitigates epilepsy and cognitive impairment via NLRP3 inhibition in rats.",
  "abstract": "The nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders, including epilepsy, through its role in inflammation and pyroptosis. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) has neuroprotective effects in patients with neurological disorders. However, the impact of DHM on the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in epilepsy and related cognitive impairment is yet to be fully understood. Herein, we evaluated whether DHM can alleviate pilocarpine-induced neuronal injury and learning and memory disorders in the hippocampal body of rats by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome.",
