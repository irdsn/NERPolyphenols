  "abstract": "The liver, as the primary metabolic organ, is susceptible to an array of factors that can harm liver cells and give rise to different liver diseases. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural compound found in green tea, exerts numerous beneficial effects on the human body. Notably, EGCG displays antioxidative, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. This review specifically highlights the pivotal role of EGCG in liver-related diseases, focusing on viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. EGCG not only inhibits the entry and replication of hepatitis B and C viruses within hepatocytes, but also mitigates hepatocytic damage caused by hepatitis-induced inflammation. Furthermore, EGCG exhibits significant therapeutic potential against hepatocellular carcinoma. Combinatorial use of EGCG and anti-hepatocellular carcinoma drugs enhances the sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes. Thus, the combination of EGCG and anti-hepatocellular carcinoma drugs holds promise as an effective approach for treating drug-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, EGCG possesses hepatoprotective properties against various forms of liver damage and emerges as a potential drug candidate for liver diseases.",
