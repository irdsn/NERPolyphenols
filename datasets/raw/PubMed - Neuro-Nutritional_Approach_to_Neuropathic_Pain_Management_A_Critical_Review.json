  "abstract": "Pain is a significant global public health issue that can interfere with daily activities, sleep, and interpersonal relationships when it becomes chronic or worsens, ultimately impairing quality of life. Despite ongoing efforts, the efficacy of pain treatments in improving outcomes for patients remains limited. At present, the challenge lies in developing a personalized care and management plan that helps to maintain patient activity levels and effectively manages pain. Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition resulting from damage to the somatosensory nervous system, significantly impacting quality of life. It is partly thought to be caused by inflammation and oxidative stress, and clinical research has suggested a link between this condition and diet. However, these links are not yet well understood and require further investigation to evaluate the pathways involved in neuropathic pain. Specifically, the question remains whether supplementation with dietary antioxidants, such as melatonin, could serve as a potential adjunctive treatment for neuropathic pain modulation. Melatonin, primarily secreted by the pineal gland but also produced by other systems such as the digestive system, is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aging properties. It is found in various fruits and vegetables, and its presence alongside other polyphenols in these foods may enhance melatonin intake and contribute to improved health. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of neuropathic pain and examine the potential role of melatonin as an adjunctive treatment in a neuro-nutritional approach to pain management.",
