  "abstract": "Red-fleshed apple cultivars with an enhanced content of polyphenolic compounds have attracted increasing interest due to their promising health benefits. Here, we have analysed the polyphenolic content of young, red-fleshed apples (RFA) and optimised extraction conditions of phenolics by utilising natural deep eutectic solvents (NDES). We also compare the antioxidant, neuroprotective and antimicrobial activities of NDES- and methanol-extracted phenolics from young RFA. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) was used for phenolics identification and quantification. Besides young RFA, ripe red-fleshed, young and ripe white-fleshed apples were analysed, revealing that young RFA possess the highest phenolic content (2078.4 ± 4.0 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g), and that ripe white-fleshed apples contain the least amount of phenolics (545.0 ± 32.0 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g). The NDES choline chloride-glycerol containing 40 % w/w H2O gave similar yields at 40 °C as methanol. In addition, the polyphenolics profile, and bioactivities of the NDES extract from young RFA were comparable that of methanol extracts. Altogether, our data show that NDES extracts of young RFA are a promising source of bioactive polyphenolics with potential applications in diverse sectors, e.g., for functional food production, smart material engineering and natural therapies.",
