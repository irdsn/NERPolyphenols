  "abstract": "Phytoremediation is a promising technology for treating Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME). Moreover, phytoremediators have the potential for various aplication, including as feedstock. Hence, this study aims to elucidate the ability of sea grapes (Caulerpa racemosa) in remediating POME and evaluate their suitability as ornamental fish feed. Results showed that application of sea grapes effectively decreased the COD, TSS, phosphate (PO43-), and nitrate (NO3-) levels in POME. Sea grapes maintained in POME with a concentration of 12.5% had the highest reduction rate and growth performance. Moreover, sea grapes biomass from the remediation process can be utilized as feed material for ornamental fish, as indicated by increasing skin coloration of fish. For the first time, this study provides sustainable options for managing POME using sea grapes and suggests sea grapes as a potential fish feed formulation for ornamental fish.",
