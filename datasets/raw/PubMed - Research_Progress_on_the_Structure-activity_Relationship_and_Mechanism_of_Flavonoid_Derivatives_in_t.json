  "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The difficulty in early diagnosis, combined with the tendency for tumor invasion and metastasis, creates significant challenges for current therapeutic approaches. Additionally, the pharmaceutical agents currently used to treat NSCLC often come with severe side effects and can lead to drug resistance. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic agents with fewer side effects that can effectively overcome resistance mechanisms. Flavonoids, a prominent class of natural compounds, have shown promise in preventing and treating various cancers. By structurally optimizing flavonoids, it is possible to enhance their anticancer activity and improve their pharmacokinetic properties. This article reviews the different mechanisms of action and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of flavonoid derivatives in treating NSCLC, aiming to provide a scientific foundation for developing new therapeutic agents.",
