  "abstract": "The taste quality varies greatly among black teas processed at different stages of spring; however, the key differential metabolites and the mechanisms underlying their differences are unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare the taste and metabolite contents of black tea produced in early and late spring, and investigate their influencing mechanisms. To this end, we evaluated the sensory and taste components of black teas produced during early and late spring, as well as the metabolites and the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities of fresh tea leaves harvested at different times in this study. Metabolomic analysis revealed that catechins, theanine, and flavonol glycosides were the potential key components responsible for taste variation in the black teas. The final contents of theanine and flavonol glycosides in the black teas were influenced by the initial levels of these compounds in fresh leaves, whereas the contents of catechins were affected by both their initial levels and the activities of PPO and POD in fresh leaves. Furthermore, ANS and F3GlcT were found to be crucial genes influencing the differential accumulation of flavonoids in fresh tea leaves during spring. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying taste variations between black teas produced in early and late spring.",
