  "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making the search for alternatives for its control a critical issue. In this context, exploring alternatives from natural sources, such as certain vegetables containing a variety of secondary metabolites with beneficial effects on the body and that play a crucial role in the fight against cancer, is essential. Among the compounds with the greatest efficacy in controlling this disease, those with antioxidant activity, particularly phenolic com-pounds, stand out. A remarkable example of this group is protocatechuic acid (PCA), which has been the subject of various revealing research on its activities in different areas. These studies sustain that protocatechuic acid has anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antidiabetic, antiulcer, antiviral, antifibrogenic, antiallergic, neuroprotective, antibacterial, anticancer, antiosteoporotic, anti-aging, and analgesic properties, in addition to offering protection against metabolic syndrome and con-tributing to the preservation of hepatic, renal, and reproductive functionality. Therefore, this paper aims to review the biological activities of PCA, focusing on its anticancer potential and its in-volvement in the control of various molecular pathways involved in tumor development, sup-porting its option as a promising alternative for cancer treatment.",
