  "abstract": "Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound found in grapes, berries, and traditional medicinal plants like Polygonum cuspidatum, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine systems for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective properties. Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by intestinal barrier disruption due to excessive colonocyte apoptosis, leading to increased permeability and inflammation. Targeting apoptosis is a critical therapeutic strategy for UC.",
