  "abstract": "Recent reports have indicated that elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are closely linked to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in neurological disorders. Oroxylin A (OA) is a key bioactive flavonoid that has been reported to regulate brain functions. However, the role of OA in Hcy-related BBB dysfunction is less reported. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role and molecular mechanism of OA in Hcy-mediated BBB dysfunction using bothin vivoandin vitroinvestigations. Our findings indicate that the expression of the tight junction (TJ) protein Claudin-5 declined, and the diffusion of sodium fluorescein elevated in brains of Hcy-challenged mice. These effects were notably rescued by administration of OA. In Hcy-challenged bEnd.3 brain microvascular endothelial cells, increased endothelial permeability, reduced trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), and downregulated Claudin-5 were observed. These effects were significantly reversed by 25 and 50 Î¼M OA. Interestingly, OA treatment restored the dephosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 induced by Hcy. However, the addition of the protein kinase A/cAMP-response element binding protein (PKA/CREB) inhibitor H89 counteracted the protective effects of OA on inhibiting endothelial permeability and promoting Claudin-5 expression. Together, we demonstrate that OA protects against Hcy-induced BBB dysfunction by maintaining the integrity of endothelial barriers. This protective effect is achieved through the activation of the CREB/Claudin-5 signaling pathway, highlighting the potential therapeutic value of OA in addressing BBB-related neurological disorders.",
