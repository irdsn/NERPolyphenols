  "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of paeonol in ameliorating chronic stress-induced amygdala neuronal injury via modulation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)/calcineurin signaling pathway. Paeonol, a polyphenolic compound from Moutan Cortex, exhibits therapeutic effects. Studies show it alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behaviors in mice, though its mechanisms remain unclear.",
