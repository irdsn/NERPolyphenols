  "abstract": "Combining natural antioxidants with nanozymes represents a promising strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes in oxidative stress-related diseases. This study integrates quercetin (Que), a plant-derived flavonoid with strong antioxidant activity, and cerium oxide nanozymes (CeO2NZs) into mesoporous silica (mSiO2) to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome the poor solubility and bioavailability of natural antioxidants.",
