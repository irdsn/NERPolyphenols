  "abstract": "Natural phenolic compounds (NPCs) have been proven to effectively extend the storage time of meat products in recent years. To promote the discovery of more NPCs and their applications, this review examines recent progress in the classification, antioxidant, and antibacterial mechanisms of NPCs used in meat products. These compounds are found in both edible and inedible parts of plants, including fruits, vegetables, and trees. The recycling of agricultural by-products aligns with green agricultural trends and serves as a guideline for developing new sources of natural additives. Studies on the application of NPCs in various livestock and poultry products, either directly mixed into the matrix or indirectly contacted by preparation into bioactive films and packaging materials, has highlighted the great potential of NPCs. The pro-oxidative effects of NPCs on proteins and their interactions with biological macromolecules, such as proteins, provide new ideas for in-depth research on antioxidant and antibacterial mechanisms.",
