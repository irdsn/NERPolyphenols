  "abstract": "Grape liqueurs are a promising approach to diversifying fruit-derived beverages and adding value to local raw materials. This study evaluated the impact of cereal alcohol (A) and white cachaça (C) on the physicochemical composition, anthocyanin profile, and sensory attributes of liqueurs made with the Brazilian cultivar BRS Carmem. Both products met regulatory requirements (alcohol content > 15%v/vand sugar > 100 g⋅L-1). The alcoholic base significantly influenced most physicochemical parameters but not the anthocyanin profile. The liqueur with A resulted in higher extraction of organic acids (0.39 vs. 0.33 g tartaric acid⋅100 g-1) and phenolic compounds (607.45 vs. 457.64 mg gallic acid⋅100 g-1). HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed a predominance of diglycosylated anthocyanins (98%), with concentrations of 420.04 mg⋅L-1(A) and 456.44 mg⋅L-1(C). Both liqueurs were well accepted (overall impression: A = 7.1, C = 7.2) with good purchase intent (A = 63.03% and C = 56.75%). Significant differences were observed for appearance and color (preferred in A) and aroma (preferred in C). These attributes correlated strongly with the overall impression, but flavor and alcohol content were the key factors influencing purchase decisions. The findings demonstrate that the choice of alcoholic base affects the composition and sensory acceptance of grape liqueurs, highlighting their importance to enhance the product's quality.",
