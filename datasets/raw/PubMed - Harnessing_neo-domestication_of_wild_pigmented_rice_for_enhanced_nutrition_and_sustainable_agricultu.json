  "title": "Harnessing neo-domestication of wild pigmented rice for enhanced nutrition and sustainable agriculture.",
  "abstract": "Advances in precision gene editing have enabled the rapid domestication of wild crop relatives, a process known as neo-domestication. During domestication, breeding rice for maximum productivity under optimal growth conditions reduced genetic diversity, eliminating variants for stress tolerance and grain nutrients. Wild rice varieties have rich genetic diversity, including variants for disease resistance, stress tolerance, and grain nutritional quality. For example, the grain of pigmented wild rice has abundant antioxidants (anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and flavonoids), but low yield, poor plant architecture, and long life cycle limit its cultivation. In this review, we address the neo-domestication of wild pigmented rice, focusing on recent progress, CRISPR-Cas editing toolboxes, selection of key candidate genes for domestication, identifying species with superior potential via generating genomic and multi-omics resources, efficient crop transformation methods and highlight strategies for the promotion and application pigmented rice. We also address critical outstanding questions and potential solutions to enable efficient neo-domestication of wild pigmented rice and thus enhance food security and nutrition.",
