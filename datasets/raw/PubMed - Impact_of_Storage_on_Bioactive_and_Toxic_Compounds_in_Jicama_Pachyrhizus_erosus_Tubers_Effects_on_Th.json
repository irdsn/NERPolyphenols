  "abstract": "Jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus) tubers contain isoflavones and phenolic acids with potential chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory effects. This study analyzed bioactive and toxic compounds in fresh jicama tuber (flesh and peel) and assessed changes during freezing for 3 and 4 months. Antioxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated on human thyroid cancer (FTC133, 8505 C, TPC1), and normal cells (Nthy-ori 3 - 1), and RAW 264.7 macrophages.",
