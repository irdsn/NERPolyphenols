  "abstract": "Biopolymers represent a significant class of materials with potential applications in skin care due to their beneficial properties. Resveratrol is a natural substance that exhibits a range of biological activities, including the scavenging of free radicals and anti-inflammatory and anti-aging effects. In this study, chitosan/konjac glucomannan resveratrol-enriched thin films were prepared. The enrichment of biomaterials with active ingredients is a common practice, as it allows the desired properties to be obtained in the final product. To characterize the films, several analyses were performed, including infrared spectroscopy, imaging of the samples by SEM and AFM techniques, swelling analysis in pH 5.5 and 7.4, mechanical and antioxidant assays, contact angle measurements, and determination of the resveratrol release profile under the skin mimicking conditions. Resveratrol incorporation into the matrices resulted in modifications to the chemical structure and film morphology. The mechanical characteristics of films with additives were found to undergo deterioration. The sample containing 10% of resveratrol exhibited a higher swelling degree than other films. The resveratrol-modified films demonstrated a notable antioxidant capacity, a reduced contact angle, and enhanced wettability. The resveratrol release occurred rapidly initially, with a maximum of 84% and 56% of the substance released depending on the sample type. Thus, the proposed formulations have promising properties, in particular good swelling capacity, high antioxidant potential, and improved wettability, and may serve as skin dressings after further investigation.",
