  "abstract": "Background/Objectives:Periploca chevalieriBrowicz (Apocynaceae), an endemic species of the Cabo Verde archipelago, is commonly used in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. The aim of this study was to characterize the chemical profiles of the aqueous and hydroethanolic (70%) extracts of theP. chevalieridried aerial parts (PcAE and PcEE) and evaluate their potential to modulate postprandial glycemia and inhibit key carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes.Methods:The chemical characterization was performed by LC/UV-DAD-ESI/MS/MS. An in vivo evaluation of postprandial glycemia modulation was conducted on healthy CD1 mice submitted to an oral sucrose tolerance test. In vitro enzymatic inhibition was performed for the α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and DPP4 enzymes. Additionally, antioxidant and antiglycation activities were also assessed.Results:Phenolic acid derivatives, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, and flavonols were the major classes of secondary metabolites identified. PcEE at 170 mg/kg of body weight significantly (p< 0.05) reduced the postprandial glycemia peak in CD1 mice submitted to sucrose overload. Regarding the enzymatic inhibition, both extracts showed concentration-dependent inhibitory potential against the α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and DPP4 enzymes. Both extracts inhibited α-glucosidase more effectively than acarbose.Conclusions:The obtained results supports the traditional use ofP. chevalieriand suggest the potential for further pharmacological investigation.",
