  "abstract": "Carotid arteriosclerosis is common, with interventional therapy being the primary treatment. However, postoperative restenosis and poor stent patency, related to vascular inflammation involving MAPK and PP2A, limit success. Formononetin (FOR) may offer a novel approach by activating PP2A and inhibiting MAPK, reducing inflammation and improving outcomes.",
