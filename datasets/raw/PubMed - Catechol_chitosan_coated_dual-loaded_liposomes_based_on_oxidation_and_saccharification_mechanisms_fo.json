  "abstract": "Skin aging has become a major urgent problem to be solved. Evidence reveals that oxidation and glycosylation are two dominant inducements of aging. Resveratrol (RES) with outstanding anti-oxidant effect and carnosine (CAR) with superb anti-glycation property were selected as two model drugs to evaluate the feasibility of their synergistic anti-aging effect. RES and CAR at the most desired mass ratio, supplying the most superior synergistic anti-aging effects were further encapsulated in liposomes (LP), which were separately coated with chitosan (CS) and catechol chitosan (Cat-CS) to increase the transdermal penetration. Their anti-aging efficacy was explored in human skin fibroblast (HSF) and human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells, as well as the back skin of guinea pigs. Herein, RES and CAR at the mass ratio of 2:1 exhibited the most ideal synergistic anti-aging effect. The constructed liposomes have been shown to possess excellent fundamental properties and sustained-release properties. The aging-related indicator levels in the two cells and guinea pigs were obviously improved for the RES + CAR@Cat-CS-LP group. Additionally, skin appearance, tissue morphology, and collagen content were visibly improved, indicating its perfect anti-aging effect. In conclusion, RES + CAR@Cat-CS-LP is expected to be exploited as a potential anti-aging drug delivery system.",
