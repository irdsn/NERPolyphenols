  "abstract": "Endometriosis (E) is an oestrogen-dependent, multifactorial, inflammatory disease causing pelvic pain and infertility. Several concerns have been raised about the role of food contaminants, in particular Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), potentially involved in the onset and propagation of E. Conventional therapies- which have considerable side effects - focus on reducing levels of oestrogens and counteracting inflammation. The potential preventive/protective role of plant extracts (PEs) on phthalate (PH) -induced E is studied by a stepwise approach.",
