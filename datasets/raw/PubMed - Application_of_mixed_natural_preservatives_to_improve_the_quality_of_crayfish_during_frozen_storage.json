  "abstract": "To maintain the quality of crayfish during frozen storage, this study investigated the preservation effect of mixed natural preservatives (MNP) that consist of epsilon-polylysine hydrochloride, rosemary extract and tea polyphenols. Moreover, the efficacy of MNP was compared with liquid nitrogen quick-freezing (NQ) and chemical preservatives (PS), which represent the common preservation techniques for frozen crayfish. The results revealed that the MNP treatment significantly retarded the quality deterioration of frozen crayfish, followed by the PS and NQ treatments. The highest total sulfhydryl contents and lowest carbonyl contents indicated that the MNP treatment efficiently suppressed the degradation of myofibrillar proteins in crayfish, which was further confirmed by the TCA-soluble peptides and SDS-PAGE assay. Moreover, the MNP treatment effectively inhibited the water migration and sensorial deterioration in frozen crayfish. Overall, this study provided useful information on the potential application of MNP to enhance the storage quality of frozen crayfish.",
