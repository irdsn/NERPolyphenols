  "abstract": "Cancer is recognized as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In recent years, advancements in early detection and expanding treatment options have contributed to a decrease in mortality rates. However, the emergence of drug-resistant cancers necessitates the exploration of innovative and more effective drugs. The Akt kinases play a central role in various signaling pathways that regulate crucial cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism. Due to frequent disruptions of the Akt signaling pathway in numerous human cancers and its broad biological implications, targeting this pathway has become a key focus in combating tumor aggressiveness and a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Curcumin, a compound found in turmeric, has been extensively studied for its potential as an anti-cancer agent. It demonstrates inhibitory effects on cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis by influencing various processes involved in tumor growth and development. These effects are achieved through negative regulation of transcription factors, growth factors, cytokines, protein kinases, and other oncogenic molecules. This review aims to explore curcumin's anticancer activity against different types of cancer mediated via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, as well as its practical applications in treatment.",
