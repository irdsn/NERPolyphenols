  "abstract": "Paracetamol overdose causes severe hepatotoxicity. Sonchus oleraceus is traditionally used to treat liver disorders, but its potential against paracetamol-induced liver injury is unexplored. This work aimed to investigate the protective mechanisms of an S. oleraceus extract (SOEtOH) using in vivo, histological and biochemical assessments along with metabolomics profiling and in silico studies, including molecular docking and dynamic simulations (MD).",
