  "abstract": "Three new oleanane-type triterpenes, 2α,3β-dihydroxy-12-oxooleana-9(11)-en-28-13β,28-lactone (1), 2α,3α-dihydroxy-11-oxooleana-12-en-28-oic acid (2), and 3β-hydroxy-11-oxo-28-norolean-12,17-diene (3), one new natural product 2-hydroxy-3-oxooleana-1,12-dien-28-oic acid (4), as well as three known compounds 3β,12α-dihydroxyoleanan-28,13β-olide (5), 3β-hydroxyolean-11α,12α-epoxy-13β,28-lactone (6) and 2α,3β-digydroxy-9(11),12-dien-28-oic acid (7) were isolated and elucidated from the anti-inflammatory activity fraction of the ethanol extract of Salvia rosmarinus. The structures of the compounds were identified by spectral analysis and comparison with compounds reported in the literature. The inhibitory activity of all compounds on NO production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was tested. The results showed that compounds 2, 4 and 7 had significant anti-inflammatory activity.",
