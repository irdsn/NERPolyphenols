  "abstract": "The loss of functional beta-cell mass in diabetes is directly linked to the development of diabetic complications. Although dietary flavonoids have demonstrated antidiabetic properties, their potential effects on pancreatic beta-cell preservation and their synergistic benefits with antidiabetic drugs remain underexplored. We have developed a potential functional food enriched in flavonoids by combining cocoa powder and carob flour (CCB), which has shown antidiabetic effects. Here, we investigated the ability of the CCB, alone or in combination with metformin, to preserve pancreatic beta cells in an established diabetic context and their potential synergistic effect. Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF) were fed a CCB-rich diet or a control diet, with or without metformin, for 12 weeks. Markers of pancreatic oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as relative beta-cell mass and beta-cell apoptosis, were analyzed. Results demonstrated that CCB feeding counteracted pancreatic oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant defense and reducing reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the CCB suppressed islet inflammation by preventing macrophage infiltration into islets and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with the inactivation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB). As a result, the CCB supplementation prevented beta-cell apoptosis and the loss of beta cells in ZDF diabetic animals. The observed additive effect when combining the CCB with metformin underscores its potential as an adjuvant therapy to delay the progression of type 2 diabetes.",
