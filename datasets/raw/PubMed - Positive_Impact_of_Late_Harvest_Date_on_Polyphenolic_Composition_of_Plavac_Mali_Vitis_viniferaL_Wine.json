  "abstract": "Asynchronous ripening is a significant challenge in winemaking. Green berries reduce alcohol and pH while increasing acidity. Green berries are rich in bitter and astringent compounds, with an unknown impact on wine quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of harvest date and vineyard location on the polyphenolic composition of Plavac Mali wines in Dalmatia, Croatia. Experiments were conducted in two locations, Split and Zadar, producing fifteen wines per location from four harvest dates (H1-H4), including green berry wines from H1. The first harvest date occurred 27 days after v√©raison (DAV) and the last at 69 DAV, corresponding to overripeness. Green berry wines of H1 had low alcohol content up to 4.4% (v/v) in Split. Epigallocatechin was the main flavonoid in those wines, followed by dimer B1 in Split and catechin in Zadar. Green wines from Split had a higher concentration of phenolic acids, flavan-3-ol monomers and dimers. Wines of H3 had the highest concentration of malvidin-3-O-glucoside. With a later harvest date, a dramatic decrease in catechin and dimers was observed in wines from Split, and a decrease in epicatechin, epigallocatechin and dimer B1 in those from Zadar. The final expression of the physiochemical and polyphenolic composition of Plavac Mali wine is determined by the dynamics of harvest date, location and their interactions.",
