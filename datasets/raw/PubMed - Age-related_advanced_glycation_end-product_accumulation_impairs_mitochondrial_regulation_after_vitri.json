  "abstract": "Vitrification is an important assisted reproductive technology, although it induces mitochondrial dysfunction in embryos. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether age-associated accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in oocytes impairs the recovery of embryos from cryopreservation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction/damage. Mouse eight-cell stage embryos developed in vitro were vitrified and warmed and incubated up to the blastocyst stage. AGE levels in oocytes were higher in both aged mice and AGE accumulation mouse models (MGO-mice) than those in young and control mice. In addition, the level of SIRT1 upregulation was lower for embryos of aged and MGO-mice than that for embryos of young and control mice. The highest mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content was detected in blastocysts derived from vitrified embryos of aged and MGO-mice. The spent culture medium of blastocysts derived from both aged and MGO-mice contained higher mtDNA content than that of the blastocysts derived from young and control mice. EX527 increased mtDNA content in the spent culture medium of vitrified embryos derived from young mice. In addition, p62 aggregate levels were higher in vitrified embryos of control mice than those in vitrified embryos of MGO-mice. The SIRT1 activator, resveratrol, increased p62 aggregation levels in vitrified embryos derived from young and aged mice, whereas vitrification did not affect p62 aggregation levels in embryos from aged mice. Therefore, age-associated AGE accumulation induces decreased responsive SIRT1 upregulation following vitrified-warmed treatment and impairs mitochondrial quality control activity in vitrified embryos.",
