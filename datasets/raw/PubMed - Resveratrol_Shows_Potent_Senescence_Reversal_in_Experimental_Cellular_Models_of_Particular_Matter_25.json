  "abstract": "Particular matter 2.5 (PM2.5) pollution is associated with senescence induction. Since the impact of PM2.5 on stem cell senescence and potential compounds capable of reversing this process are largely unknown, this study aimed to examine the senescence effects of PM2.5 on dermal papilla (DP) stem cells. Additionally, we explored the reversal of these effects using natural product-derived substances, such as resveratrol (Res) or Emblica fruits, soybean, and Thunbergia Laurifolia (EST) extract.",
