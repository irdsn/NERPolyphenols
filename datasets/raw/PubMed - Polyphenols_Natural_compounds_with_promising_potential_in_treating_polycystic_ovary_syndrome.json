  "abstract": "Polyphenols are natural compounds used by plants as a defense system against various stresses. In recent years, the importance of these polyhydroxyphenols has extensively increased due to their potent cardioprotection, anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, various studies have reported promising results from the studies investigating their efficacy as a therapeutic strategy in various disorders such as human malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, nervous system impairments, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, aging, and inflammation-associated disorders, as well as a polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Since oxidative stress, hormonal, metabolic, and endocrine disturbances have been shown to play a crucial role in the initiation/progression of PCOS, polyphenols are suggested to be an effective treatment for this disorder. Therefore, this study aimed to discuss the therapeutic potential of multiple polyphenols in PCOS.",
