  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as Î±-synuclein. This review explores the therapeutic potential of tannins, particularly proanthocyanidins and hydrolyzable tannins from grape seeds, in alleviating Parkinson's disease pathology. Condensed tannins exhibit significant antioxidant properties, can cross the blood-brain barrier, reduce oxidative stress, upregulate antioxidant proteins, and prevent neuronal apoptosis. Hydrolyzable tannins, through their unique chemical structure, further help reduce neuroinflammation and improve mitochondrial function. Both types of tannins can modulate inflammatory responses and enhance mitochondrial integrity, addressing key aspects of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Tannins possess excellent neuroprotective effects, representing a promising therapeutic approach. However, due to their chemical nature and structural characteristics, the bioavailability of tannins in the human body remains low. Current methods to enhance their bioavailability are limited. Further exploration is needed to improve their bioavailability and strengthen their potential clinical applications. Based on this, new Parkinson's disease treatment strategies can be developed, warranting in-depth research and clinical validation.",
