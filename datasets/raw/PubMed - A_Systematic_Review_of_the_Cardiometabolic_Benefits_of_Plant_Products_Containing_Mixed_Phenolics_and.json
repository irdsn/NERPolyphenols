  "title": "A Systematic Review of the Cardiometabolic Benefits of Plant Products Containing Mixed Phenolics and Polyphenols in Postmenopausal Women: Insufficient Evidence for Recommendations to This Specific Population.",
  "abstract": "Menopause is characterized by endocrine and physiological changes and is often accompanied by increased body weight and cholesterol, glucose intolerance, and/or hypertension. These alterations are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that may be moderate by dietary plant phenolic compounds. In this review, we examine the current evidence of the impact of a variety of plant products (foods, extracts, beverages) rich in a mixture of phenolics and polyphenols on: (i) glucose and insulin levels; (ii) lipid profile; (iii) blood pressure; and (iv) biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women. We critically evaluate both the results of a range of intervention studies conducted in this specific subpopulation and the level of evidence supporting the benefits of consuming those products after the menopause. Overall, the current available evidence does not allow for specific dietary recommendations of these plant products rich in phenolics and polyphenols in this high-risk subpopulation. Our data show rather variable and small effects of the different products examined on the cardiometabolic biomarkers and further support the need to: (1) improve the quality of the study designs and data reporting; and (2) understand the variability in the response of the different biomarkers and establish clear differences between healthy and cardiometabolic disease levels.",
