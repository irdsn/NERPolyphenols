  "abstract": "In order to ensure the safety of the raw material vegetable oil deodorizer distillate (VODD) using in vitamin E and phytosterols production process, it is necessary to rapidly and sensitively detect the content of Zearalenone (ZEN) mycotoxins. In this study, the catalytic activity of ZIF-8 was enhanced by adding copper, and the synergistic effect of calcined UIO-66 and Cu-ZIF-8 was used to improve the electrical response of the sensor to ZEN, improve the conductivity and promote electron transfer, so as to enhance the recognition ability of ZEN. Cu-ZiF-8@CN-UIO-66 biomimetic enzyme was prepared and characterized using SEM, EDS, XPS, XRD and FT-IR. The linear range of the biosensor for ZEN detection was 10 ng mL-1-25 μg mL-1, and the detection limit was as low as 0.6 ng mL-1. The experiment result indicated that the prepared composite nano-biomimetic enzyme was an ideal choice for the detection of ZEN in VODD and showed a broad application prospect in mycotoxin analysis.",
