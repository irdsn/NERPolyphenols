  "title": "New LFA-1 inhibitor Orientin reduces angiotensin II-induced vascular remodeling.",
  "abstract": "The interaction between monocytes and vascular endothelium often leads to inflammatory reactions and vascular remodeling. The lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) plays a crucial role in promoting leukocyte adhesion and migration during inflammatory diseases. However, the role of LFA1 in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension and vascular remodeling is not clear. Orientin (Ori) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and resistance to myocardial remodeling. However, the role of Orientin remains unclear in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension and vascular remodeling.",
