  "abstract": "Lophatherum gracile Brongn., also known as Dan-Zhu-Ye, is traditionally used to clear heat and purge fire, relieve irritability and thirst, diuresis and catharsis. Our preliminary research revealed that total flavonoid extracts from Lophantherum gracile Brongn. (TFLG) can reverse the inflammatory response induced by LPS in mice, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.",
