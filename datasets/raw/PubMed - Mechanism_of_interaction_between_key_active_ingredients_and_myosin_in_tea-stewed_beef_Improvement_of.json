  "title": "Mechanism of interaction between key active ingredients and myosin in tea-stewed beef: Improvement of myosin's structural and functional characteristics.",
  "abstract": "This study analyzed the tea polyphenol components in four types of tea-stewed beef, identifying five key active compounds: epicatechin (EC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), and caffeine (CAF). Oxidative stability, structural changes, and antioxidant activity of complexes formed between these compounds and bovine myosin were assessed. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations were employed to investigate the interaction mechanisms. Results indicated that all five ingredients improved myosin's oxidative stability. Polyphenols modified myosin's surface hydrophobicity, proteolytic susceptibility, and secondary structure. Among the compounds, CAF exhibited the highest surface hydrophobicity (0.01658 mg) and the lowest proteolysis (22.94 %). EC enhanced myosin's secondary structure, and improved overall stability. Interactions of EC, ECG, EGCG, and GCG with myosin were driven by electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, whereas CAF's interaction was primarily hydrophobic. This study provides a foundation for future research on polyphenol-protein interactions, complementing studies on tea's impact on meat quality.",
