  "abstract": "Hyperuricemia has a suspected relationship with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. Endocrine disruptors may affect uric acid metabolism; however, few epidemiologic studies have been performed in children regarding newly developed bisphenol A (BPA) substitutes. We evaluated the associations between BPA, bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol F (BPF) exposure and serum uric acid concentrations in 6-year-old Korean children.",
