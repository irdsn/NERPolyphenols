  "abstract": "Two new ring B-seco flavonoids (1and2), five new cadinane sesquiterpenoids (3-7), and three previously described relevant isolates (8-10) are isolated from a beloved food and spice with medicinal properties (Cinnamomum cassiaPresl's bark). Structures of all isolates are determined using the spectroscopic technique, X-ray crystallography method, and quantum chemical calculation. Notably, compounds1and2are rare ring B-seco flavonoids with a 6/6/5/5 tetracyclic skeleton. Ring B-seco flavonoids are unusual secondary metabolites, and only seven ring B-seco flavonoids featuring the 6/6/5/5 tetracyclic skeleton have been reported. The biogenetic pathways for compounds1and2are proposed. Alcohol-induced hepatocyte injury model is employed to evaluate their hepatoprotective activities. The results display that all compounds exhibit different extents of hepatoprotective activities, integrating into cell viability amelioration and fat accumulation alleviation. The potencies of compounds5and10are better than those of silymarin. Hepatoprotective activities of oppositane sesquiterpenoids are first reported.",
