  "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) has emerged as a critical illness, with sepsis-related ALI accounting for >80 %. In the context of bacterial infection, damage to the pulmonary microvascular barrier leads to inflammatory cell infiltration and plasma component extravasation into pulmonary interstitium. This disruption impairs gas exchange, resulting in hypoxemia. Norwogonin (NWG), a natural plant flavone, has shown potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. However, whether it could ameliorate sepsis-related ALI and the potential mechanism remains unknown.",
