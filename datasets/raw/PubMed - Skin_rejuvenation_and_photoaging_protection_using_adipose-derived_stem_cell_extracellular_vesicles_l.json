  "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles from adipose-derived stem cells (ASC-sEVs) have gained remarkable attention for their regenerative and protective properties against skin aging. However, the use of ASC-sEVs to further encapsulate certain natural anti-aging compounds for synergistic effects has not been actively explored. For large-scale production in skincare industry, it is also crucial to standardize cost-effective methods to produce highly pure ASC-sEVs.",
