  "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers globally and is considered a serious public health problem associated with high death rates. The current therapeutic regimes for skin cancer are limited by their low bioavailability, generation of resistance, or adverse side effects. Many fruit extract-based nutraceuticals hold potential as topical treatment methods. Pyrus communis (Pear) fruit extract is a rich source of cholinergic acid, presently used as therapy for various skin diseases. Thus, it qualifies as a promising candidate for skin cancer treatment.",
