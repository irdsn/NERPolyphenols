  "abstract": "Beyond their role as emulsifiers of lipophilic compounds, bile acids (BAs) are signaling endocrine molecules that show differential affinity and specificity for a variety of canonical and non-canonical BA receptors. Primary BAs (PBAs) are synthesized in the liver while secondary BAs (SBAs) are gut microbial metabolites of PBA species. PBAs and SBAs signal to BA receptors that regulate downstream pathways of inflammation and energy metabolism. Dysregulation of BA metabolism or signaling has emerged as a feature of chronic disease. Dietary polyphenols are non-nutritive plant-derived compounds associated with decreased risk of metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, hepatobiliary and cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that the health promoting effects of dietary polyphenols are linked to their ability to alter the gut microbial community, the BA pool, and BA signaling. In this review we provide an overview of BA metabolism and summarize studies that link the cardiometabolic improvements of dietary polyphenols to their modulation of BA metabolism and signaling pathways, and the gut microbiota. Finally, we discuss approaches and challenges in deciphering cause-effect relationships between dietary polyphenols, BAs, and gut microbes.",
