  "abstract": "Shear emulsifying (SE), ball milling (BM), and autoclave treatment (AT) were utilized for the modification of lotus leaves, and the effects on in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) from lotus leaves were compared. Compared with SEIDF and ATIDF, BMIDF released more polyphenols and exhibited better antioxidant capacity during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The IDF of lotus leaves changed the gut microbiota composition during in vitro colonic fermentation. SEIDF was beneficial to the diversity of gut microbiota compared with BMIDF and ATIDF. Among the three IDF groups of lotus leaves, six significant differences of OTUs were all in ATIDF; however there was the highest relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella in ATIDF. In addition, the concentrations of butyric acid and valeric acid produced by SEIDF were significantly higher than that of BMIDF and ATIDF. Overall, SE modification improved the colonic fermentation characteristics of IDFs in lotus leaves more effectively; while BM modification helped to promote the release of polyphenols from IDFs in lotus leaves during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The research lays the foundation for the application of the dietary fiber of lotus leaves as a premium fiber additive in functional food.",
