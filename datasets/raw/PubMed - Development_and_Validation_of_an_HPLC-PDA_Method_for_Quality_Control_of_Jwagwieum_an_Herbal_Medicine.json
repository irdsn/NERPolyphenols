  "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Jwagwieum (or Joa-Gui Em; JGE) consists of six herbal medicines,Rehmannia glutinosa(Gaertn.) DC.,Dioscorea japonicaThunb.,Lycium chinenseMill.,Cornus officinalisSiebold & Zucc.,Poria cocosWolf, andGlycyrrhiza uralensisFisch., and has been widely used to treat kidney-yin deficiency syndrome. In the present study, a high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) method for the simultaneous quantification of the nine components, i.e., gallic acid, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural, morroniside, loganin, liquiritin apioside, liquiritin, ononin, glycyrrhizin, and allantoin, was developed.Methods: The developed HPLC-PDA assay for quality control of JGE was validated with respect to linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), recovery, and precision.Results: In the regression equation of the calibration curve, the coefficient of determination was ≥0.9980, and LOD and LOQ were 0.003-0.071 μg/mL and 0.010-0.216 μg/mL, respectively. Recovery and precision (relative standard deviation) were 96.36-106.95% and <1.20%, respectively. In this analytical method, nine compounds were detected at concentrations of 0.15-3.69 mg/lyophilized gram.Conclusions: The developed and validated analytical method could be used to obtain basic data for the quality control of JGE and related herbal prescriptions.",
