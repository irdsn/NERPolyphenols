  "title": "Chinese Sausage Simulates High Calorie-Induced Obesity In Vivo, Identifying the Potential Benefits of Weight Loss and Metabolic Syndrome of Resveratrol Butyrate Monomer Derivatives.",
  "abstract": "This study examined the health benefits of 3-O-butanoylresveratrol (ED4), a monoester derivative of resveratrol butyrate esters. Using a high-calorie diet model simulation with Chinese sausage, ED4 was tested against changes in physiological indices like body weight (BW), body fat, blood pressure, and SCFA levels (stools and serum) in rats. This study found that the obesity-inducing model utilizing sausage as a high-calorie diet worked, and that supplementing rats with ED4 (20 mg/kg BW/day) for 5 weeks inhibited BW increase and body fat buildup. Blood lipid and SCFA dysregulation improved significantly. In addition, ED4 effectively increased PPAR-γ and decreased SREBP-1C mRNA expression, preventing fat accumulation and overproduction. A novel food-driven relationship between gut microbiota and adipose was found, promoting health. Our findings showed that ED4 supplementation exacerbated metabolic abnormalities caused by high-calorie diets and reduced body fat. Notably, these metabolic benefits were enhanced through the involvement of intestinal microbiota.",
