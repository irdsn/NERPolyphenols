  "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing demand for plant-based beverages that meet nutritional and health needs and have an appealing taste. This study investigated the impact of fermentation with Lactobacillus strains, Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Torulaspora delbrueckii D1-3 on the nutritional quality and aroma compound profile of a sea buckthorn-based cereal beverage. The mixed starter fermented samples, specifically S-APTD (SBCB inoculated with A. pasteurianus, and T. delbrueckii D1-3), showed significant increases in protein and free amino acid (FAA) content, recording values of 9.02 ± 0.01 mg/g and 5468.33 ± 20.31 µg/g, respectively. Proanthocyanidin and β-carotene contents were significantly higher in the mixed SBCB compared to the control, particularly in samples containing A. pasteurianus. Interestingly, the fermentation process also resulted in the reduction and absence of butanoic acid, which was higher in the control, and the complete degradation of phthalates present in the control. Phenylethyl alcohol emerged as the dominant alcohol in SBCB, particularly in the mixed starter fermented samples, while lactic acid was the most prevalent acid in the mixed starter samples except S-APLA (SBCB inoculated with A. pasteurianus and Lactobacillus acidophilus). Ultimately, a functional beverage with enhanced nutritional value and an improved aroma profile can be developed through fermentation with these strains.",
