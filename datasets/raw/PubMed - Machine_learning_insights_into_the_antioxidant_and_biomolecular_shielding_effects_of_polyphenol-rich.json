  "abstract": "This study investigated the antioxidant and biomolecular shielding effects of polyphenol-rich extracts from 18 date palm pit varieties. Phytochemical profiling revealed significant varietal differences, with catechin (358.48 mg/100 g in Maghool) and gallic acid (34.55 mg/100 g in Khalas) as dominant compounds. Antioxidant assays demonstrated robust activity, with Shikat alkahlas showing 64.10 % DPPH inhibition and Maghool exhibiting the highest FRAP value (190.57 mmol Fe2+/100 g). Enzyme inhibition varied widely: Maghool inhibited tyrosinase by 65.40 %, while Shabebe showed 42.21 % α-amylase inhibition. Protective effects against DNA and BSA damage were pronounced in Sagay (39.99 % supercoiled DNA retention) and Jabri (98.95 % BSA protection). An XGBoost model predicted antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and protective activities with up to 92.57 % accuracy, identifying catechin and cinnamic acid as key predictors. These findings underscore the potential of date pits as sustainable sources of bioactive compounds for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.",
