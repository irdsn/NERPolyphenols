  "abstract": "High fat consumption leads to the development of fatty liver or hepatic steatosis, which contributes to liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early intervention is crucial to prevent this health issue. Black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica) and green tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) are traditional Thai supplements known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical composition, biological activities, and anti-lipid accumulation effect of Pulsed Electric Field (PEF)-Processed black rice extract (BRE) and green tea extract (GTE) in oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells. The PEF technology was utilized for extraction, increasing the yield of active compounds. HPLC profiles revealed that BRE is mainly composed of anthocyanins, particularly Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), while GTE is rich in catechins, especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Both extracts showed a strong radical scavenging activity and effective reducing power. In oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells, monotherapy and combination therapy of the extracts significantly reduced lipid accumulation, AST activity, and IL-6 levels. These findings suggest that BRE, GTE, and their combination exhibit potent hepatoprotective properties through reducing lipid accumulation, liver damage, and inflammation, highlighting their potential therapeutic application in the management of hepatic steatosis.",
