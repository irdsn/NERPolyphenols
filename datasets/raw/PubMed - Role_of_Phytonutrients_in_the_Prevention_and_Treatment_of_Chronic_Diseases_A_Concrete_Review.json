  "abstract": "Delving into the intricate role of phytonutrients is paramount to effectively preventing and treating chronic diseases. Phytonutrients are \"plant-based nutrients\" that positively affect human health. Phytonutrients perform primary therapeutic functions in the management and treatment of various diseases. It is reported that different types of pathogenesis occur due to the excessive production of oxidants (reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species). The literature shows that a higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based food is inversely related to treating different chronic diseases. Due to many phytonutrients (antioxidants) in fruits, vegetables, and other medicinal plants, they are considered major therapeutic agents for various diseases. The main purpose of this review is to summarize the major phytonutrients involved in preventing and treating diseases. Fourteen major phytonutrients are discussed in this review, such as polyphenols, anthocyanin, resveratrol, phytosterol (stigmasterol), flavonoids, isoflavonoids, limonoids, terpenoids, carotenoids, lycopene, quercetin, phytoestrogens, glucosinolates, and probiotics, which are well-known for their beneficial effects on the human body and treatment of different pathological conditions. It is concluded that phytonutrients play a major role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, other types of cancers, neurological disorders, age-related diseases, and inflammatory disorders and are also involved in various biological activities.",
