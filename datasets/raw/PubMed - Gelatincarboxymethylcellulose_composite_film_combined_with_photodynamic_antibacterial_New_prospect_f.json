  "abstract": "Plastic packaging causes environmental pollution, and the development of simple and effective biodegradable active packaging remains a challenge. In this study, gelatin (G) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were used as film materials, with the addition of curcumin (Cur), a photosensitive substance, to investigate the changes in the physical and chemical properties of the film and its application in fruit preservation. The results demonstrated that Cur was compatible with the film. With the addition of Cur, the thickness of the film increased up to 1.3 times, while the moisture content was reduced to 12.10 %. The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of the film can reach 8.84 MPa and 19.33 %, respectively. The photodynamic antibacterial experiment revealed that the film containing 0.5 % Cur exhibited the highest antibacterial rate, reaching 99.99 % against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and 95 % against Escherichia coli (E. coli). During storage, the grapes remained unspoiled for up to 9 days after being phototreated with the film and the microbial content of the skin was much lower than that of the control group. In addition, Cur provided antioxidant activity for the film, with a scavenging activity of 39.54 % against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrind radical (DPPH). Bananas exposed to the film-forming solution for a short period of time remained fresh for up to 6 days. During preservation, the weight of the treated bananas decreased more slowly than that of the control group. In addition, the activity of SOD on the 7th day was approximately 20 U/g higher than that of the control group, which helped to reduce oxidative stress during banana preservation. In summary, G-CMC/Cur film is an optional fruit-cling film that can be used in food packaging.",
