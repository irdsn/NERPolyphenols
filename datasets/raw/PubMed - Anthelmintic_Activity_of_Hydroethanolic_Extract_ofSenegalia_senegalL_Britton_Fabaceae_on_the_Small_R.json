  "abstract": "Anthelmintics used to control haemonchosis in small ruminants have several limitations; the most notable of which are resistance and reinfestation. The aim of this study was to investigate the anthelmintic effect of the hydroethanolic extract ofSenegalia senegal(HESS) against the parasiteHaemonchus contortus. The hydroethanolic extract was tested in vitro on the various developmental stages ofH. contortusand in vivo in goats infested by this parasite. The acute toxicity of HESS was assessed in mice according to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Line 425. HESS inhibited egg hatching with LC50values = 1.51 mg/mL and LC90= 2.57 mg/mL; this extract was also lethal with LC50values = 1.25 mg/mL and LC90= 1.99 mg/mL on Stage 3 larvae and LC50= 1.28 mg/mL and LC90= 1.04 mg/mL on adult females; HESS at a dose of 500 mg/kg deparasitized goats, inducing a 91.27% reduction in fecal egg excretion, a 94.73% reduction in parasite load, and a 57.65% reduction in female fertility. The secondary metabolites present in the extract were phenolic compounds, of which tannins (243.12 ± 0.76 mg ECA/gDM) accounted for the majority. HESS at a dose of 2000 mg/kg did not induce any clinical signs of toxicity or mortality in mice. These results would justify the traditional use ofS. senegalto control the gastrointestinal strongyle,H. contortus.",
