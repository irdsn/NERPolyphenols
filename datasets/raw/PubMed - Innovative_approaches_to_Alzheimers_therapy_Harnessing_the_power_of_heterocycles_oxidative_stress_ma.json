  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex pathology involving amyloidogenic proteolysis, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cholinergic deficits. Oxidative stress exacerbates AD progression through pathways like macromolecular peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metal ion redox potential alteration linked to amyloid-beta (AÎ²). Despite limited approved medications, heterocyclic compounds have emerged as promising candidates in AD drug discovery. This review highlights recent advancements in synthetic heterocyclic compounds targeting oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation in AD. Additionally, it explores the potential of nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems to overcome challenges in AD treatment. Nanoparticles with heterocyclic scaffolds, like polysorbate 80-coated PLGA and Resveratrol-loaded nano-selenium, show improved brain transport and efficacy. Micellar CAPE and Melatonin-loaded nano-capsules exhibit enhanced antioxidant properties, while a tetra hydroacridine derivative (CHDA) combined with nano-radiogold particles demonstrates promising acetylcholinesterase inhibition without toxicity. This comprehensive review underscores the potential of nanotechnology-driven drug delivery for optimizing the therapeutic outcomes of novel synthetic heterocyclic compounds in AD management. Furthermore, the inclusion of various promising heterocyclic compounds with detailed ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) data provides valuable insights for planning the development of novel drug delivery treatments for AD.",
