  "abstract": "One of the markers of aging is oxidative stress, a condition characterized by an increase in free radicals concomitant with a reduction in antioxidant defenses. Within this, resveratrol is a compound that has been shown to act as a potent antioxidant. However, few studies highlight the cellular signaling pathways that are activated or inhibited during aging and that are responsible for this biological effect.",
