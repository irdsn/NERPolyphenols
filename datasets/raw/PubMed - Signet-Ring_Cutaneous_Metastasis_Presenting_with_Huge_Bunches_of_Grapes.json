  "abstract": "Signet-ring cell (SRC) is a histologic type in which cells show unique features under the microscope. We mainly found signet-ring cells (SRCs) in gastrointestinal and breast tumors. Cutaneous metastasis from internal carcinomas was an uncommon presentation. The cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) metastasis to the skin were rarely reported. Cutaneous metastasis indicated a poor prognosis for a patient. Here, we report a female who had huge grape-like nodules arising from gastrointestinal SRCC in her trunk and thigh.",
