  "abstract": "Caffeic acid (CA) and its derivative, chlorogenic acid (CGA), have shown promise in preventing and alleviating fatty liver disease. CA, compared to CGA, has much lower production costs and higher bioavailability, making it a potentially superior feed additive. However, the efficacy, mechanistic differences, and comparative impacts of CA and CGA on fatty liver disease in laying hens remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of CA and CGA on production performance, egg quality, and fatty liver disease in laying hens.",
