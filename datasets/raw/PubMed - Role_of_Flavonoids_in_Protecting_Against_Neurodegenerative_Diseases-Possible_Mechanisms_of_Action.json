  "title": "Role of Flavonoids in Protecting Against Neurodegenerative Diseases-Possible Mechanisms of Action.",
  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative and mood disorders represent growing medical and social problems, many of which are produced by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, disruption in the metabolism of various neurotransmitters, and some disturbances in lipid/carbohydrate homeostasis. Biologically active plant compounds, including flavonoids, have been shown to exert a positive impact on central nervous system function. This review assesses the studies of naturally occurring flavonoids belonging to various polyphenol subclasses and their mechanisms of neuroprotective action, especially against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Most of the studied phytochemicals possess anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. These phytochemicals have been considered as compounds that reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and can be used in the treatment of neurological diseases. The neuroprotective actions of some flavonoids may entail mechanisms that regulate reactive oxygen species generation and modify inflammatory pathways, and they should be considered as therapeutic agents.",
