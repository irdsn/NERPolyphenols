  "abstract": "Phenolic compounds form the largest group of phytochemical compounds in plants. They comprise nearly 8.000 molecules divided into around ten chemical classes, and more than ten classes have already been shown to have pharmacological potential. In this context, this study tested the in-vitro bioactivity, antimicrobial aspect and vegetal compounds of Artemisia herba-alba using HPLC-DAD test. Data indicated that the hemostatic effect of the chloroform fraction was more pronounced and reached a reducing rate of clotting time of 70.91% for the highest tested dose. The photoprotective effect of this fraction was considered high when compared to petroleum ether. The initial phytoscreening revealed the presence of several classes of secondary metabolites. The quantification showed a high amount of flavonoids (88.05±1.94 цg quercetin/mg fraction) in chloroform fraction, while petroleum ether fraction contained more tannins (39.55±1.46 цg tannic acid /mg fraction). HPLC DAD screening revealed the presence of several flavonoids and phenolic acids compounds while the antimicrobial simulation showed a non-negligible effect of 3 tested compounds on several microbial strains. This work revealed the phytochemical aspect of certain extracts of A. herba-alba but also its procoagulant, photoprotective and antimicrobial properties.",
