  "title": "Mineralized degradation of bisphenol A by novel photoenzyme-metal catalyst FCAP@Ag3PO4/Lac-Pd beads.",
  "abstract": "Photoenzyme synergistic catalytic technology could efficiently convert a refractory organic compound such as bisphenol A in water into non-toxic CO2and H2O under relatively mild and green conditions, representing one of the most potential low-carbon pollution reduction technologies. In this work, the functional alginate FCAP@Ag3PO4/Lac-Pd beads with 3 mm diameter were prepared for the first time to realize the mineralized degradation of bisphenol A. In the photoenzyme-metal catalytic system, the high catalytic activity arises from Pd anchoring, Ag3PO4transferred the photoelectrons generated on the surface to laccase molecule promoting to complete its redox reaction and leading to synergistic catalysis. Bisphenol A was completely mineralized into CO2and H2O using FCAP@Ag3PO4/Lac-Pd beads treating the solution of concentration 20 mg L-1for 4 h under visible light irradiation, without producing new organic materials. The FCAP@Ag3PO4/Lac-Pd beads still have considerable degradation of bisphenol A in lake water, coal washing water, and coking wastewater and the degradation efficiency was all above 85.4 %. This work would provide an innovative approach for the mineralized degradation of refractory organic pollution in water.",
