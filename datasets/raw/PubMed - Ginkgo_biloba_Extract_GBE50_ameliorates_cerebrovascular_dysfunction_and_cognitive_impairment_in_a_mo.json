  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder in which neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction plays a critical role. GBE50, a refined extract of Ginkgo biloba containing over 50 % total flavonoids and terpene lactones, is widely used in the clinical prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to its anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, its specific effects on NVU integrity and cerebrovascular function in AD remain unclear.",
