  "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is known to be the most aggressive adult brain tumor due to its high fatality rates. The ability of this tumor to induce neovascularization, migrate, and proliferate into brain tissue makes GBM a sought-after disease for a cure. However, treatment is scarce, and a cure is elusive. Recent studies in the use of plant-based compounds (phytochemicals) for the prevention and treatment of GBM exhibit promising results.",
