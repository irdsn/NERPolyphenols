  "abstract": "Breast cancer is still a major worldwide health problem. Metastasis, the dissemination of cancerous cells to distant tissues, significantly contributes to death.Galangin, a flavonoid from many plants, has shown encouraging anti-cancer effects in preclinical research. This research sought to examine the impact ofGalanginon the transcription of critical invasiveness genes in breast cancer cells.Alpinia galanga L.was extracted, and the solubility ofGalanginin excipients was assessed. MCF7 cells were punctured, and the cytotoxicity ofAlpinia galanga L.andGalanginwas assessed using the MTT assay. The induction of apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The transcription of apoptosis-related genes was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. The assessment of Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and the bioinformatics-based construction of gene networks related to breast cancer were conducted. The study found thatGalanginsignificantly increased the survival rates of MCF7 cells after 72 h of exposure to 1000 µg/ml and 500 µg/ml extracts. The IC50 was set at 500 µg/ml.Galangintreatment led to a 10.4% early apoptosis incidence, 22.2% late apoptosis, 2.39% necrosis, and a 65% survival rate.Alpinia galanga L.extract inducing apoptosis was 19.03%, whileGalanginapplication produced 32.6% apoptosis. The transcription levels ofGPXandP53genes associated with programmed cell death were significantly elevated after treatment withGalangin. The transcription level of theMMP2gene was significantly decreased in MCF7 cells treated withGalanginandAlpinia galanga L.compared to the PBS-treated group. Treatment withGalanginandAlpinia galanga L.decreased the total antioxidant capacity.Galanginsignificantly reduced the antioxidant activities compared to other groups.Galanginshows potential as an effective treatment against breast cancer by regulating cellular growth and death. Further research is required to validate the therapeutic efficacy ofGalanginand to clarify its processes in breast cancer.",
