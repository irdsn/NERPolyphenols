  "abstract": "This study investigated the protective effects of the dietary polyphenol vanillic acid (VA) on dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice, focusing on its impact on the gut microbiota and inflammatory responses. VA was supplemented following dextran sulfate sodium administration, and key indicators, including body weight, disease activity index, colon length, spleen index, and inflammatory markers, were assessed. VA supplementation significantly alleviated UC symptoms, preserved intestinal barrier integrity, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Additionally, VA positively altered the gut microbiota composition, promoting beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila while suppressing the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. Fecal microbiota transplantation confirmed that the VA-modified gut microbiota contributed to these protective effects. VA also facilitated macrophage polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, further mitigating inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of VA as a natural dietary intervention for UC, emphasizing its role in regulating the gut microbiota and inflammatory pathways, which may have significant nutritional relevance in managing inflammatory bowel diseases.",
