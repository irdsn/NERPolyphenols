  "title": "Comparative metabolomics of two nettle species unveils distinct high-altitude adaptation mechanisms on the Tibetan Plateau.",
  "abstract": "The extreme high-altitude conditions of the Tibetan Plateau, characterized by intense solar radiation, low temperatures, and reduced oxygen levels, poses significant challenges to plant survival. Plants inhabiting this region have evolved specialized mechanisms to adapt to high-altitude environments. While most studies have focused on genomic and ecological perspectives, few have explored adaptive mechanisms in a metabolic context. In particular, comparative studies examining similarities and differences in the metabolomes of closely related species are exceedingly rare. As sister species, the nettle species Urtica hyperborea and U. dioica are distributed above 4000Â m above sea level, with a sympatric distribution on the Tibetan Plateau, they provide an ideal system to investigate the aforementioned question.",
