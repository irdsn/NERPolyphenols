  "abstract": "Mangifera indicapeels discarded as non-edible portion of mango fruit are valued for its inciting repository of abundant nutrients and therapeutic benefits. The present study was aimed to examine various physicochemical and techno-functional properties, bioactive potential as well as microstructural and thermal analysis ofM. indicapeels. The results demonstrated that these are an appreciable source of phytochemicals like dietary fiber, phenolics, amino acids, carbohydrates with potent antioxidant activity. The anti-nutrients composition of peels revealed that it possesses antinutritional factors within threshold limit. The techno-functional properties indicated its potential to be utilized as emulsifier, foaming and bulking agent in food applications. FTIR, SEM, and TGA analysis ofM. indicapeels confirmed the presence of diverse antioxidant compounds and polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignans. Therefore,M. indicapeels can be explored for its potential utilization as a natural food additive in different sectors of food industries like bakery, beverage, dairy, etc.",
