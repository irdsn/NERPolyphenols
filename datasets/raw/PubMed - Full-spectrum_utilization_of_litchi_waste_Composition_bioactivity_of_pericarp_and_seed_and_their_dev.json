  "abstract": "Litchi waste (pericarps and seeds), an underutilized subtropical by-product abundant in cellulose, proanthocyanidins, and starch, presents transformative opportunities for food chemistry. This review comprehensively examines their compositional complexity, bioactive properties (anti-aging, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant), and multifunctional applications in functional food additives, bioactive packaging, and sustainable energy systems. Litchi seed starch exhibits an A-type crystalline structure with thermally stable thickening/gelling capacities, whereas micro-fibrillated cellulose derived from the pericarp has antioxidant film-forming properties. Modified litchi waste serves as an ecological adsorbent, while its derived materials-including biochar/carbon dots and porous carbon composites-exhibit potential for environmental remediation and high-performance energy storage applications. Future research priorities include optimizing extraction processes, elucidating bioactivity mechanisms, validating industrial scalability, and advancing life cycle assessments to drive circular economy integration, all of which are essential for the progress of functional food science.",
