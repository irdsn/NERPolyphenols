  "abstract": "Corinthian currant, a typical Mediterranean dried vine fruit, contains various bioactive phenolic compounds. The present study investigates the phytochemical composition of Corinthian currant through suspect screening of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and other phenolics. Using advanced mass spectrometry equipment, that is, the Exactive Plus Orbitrap and QToF, we developed and applied a methodology to identify 43 bioactive compounds, not previously reported as Corinthian currant constituents. For our study, samples from six distinct Greek cultivation areas were obtained; all 43 phenolics were present in all samples assessed. In terms of quantification, a semi-quantitative approach was applied; petunidin 3-O-arabinoside (2.18 ± 1.01 mg/100 g), peonidin 3-O-(6″-p-coumaroyl-glucoside (1.06 ± 0.81 mg/100 g), fertaric acid (1.16 ± 0.47 mg/100 g), isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside (0.28 ± 0.10 mg/100 g), and piceatannol (0.23 ± 0.12 mg/100 g) predominated in Corinthian currants across all cultivation regions. Our findings reveal the rich and diverse phenolic profile of Corinthian currant, offering valuable insights into its potential health benefits.",
