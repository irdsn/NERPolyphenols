  "title": "Anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects of flavan-4-ol and flavan glycosides from the roots of Pronephrium penangianum.",
  "abstract": "Five new flavan-4-ol glycosides jixueqiosides A-E (1-5) and two new flavan glycosides jixueqiosides F and G (6 and 7), along with twelve known flavan-4-ol glycosides (8-19), were isolated from the roots of Pronephrium penangianum. Comprehensive spectral analyses, X-ray single-crystal diffraction, and theoretical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations established structures and absolute configurations. A single crystal structure of flavan-4-ol glycoside (14) was reported for the first time, while the characteristic ECD and NMR data for all isolated flavan-4-ol glycosides (1-5 , 8-19) were analyzed, establishing a set of empirical rules. Activity screening of these isolates showed that 8 and 9 could inhibit the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with IC50values of 7.93 ? 2.85 ?mol?L-1and 5.87 ? 1.58 ?mol?L-1(MDA-MB-231), and 2.21 ? 1.38 ?mol?L-1and 3.52 ? 1.55 ?mol?L-1(MCF-7), respectively. Western blotting and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that 8 and 9 dose-dependently induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by up-regulating BAX, activating caspase-3 and down-regulating BCL-2. Additionally, compound 8 affected autophagy-related proteins, increasing the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 levels to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. Moreover, anti-inflammatory studies indicated that 2, 3, 7, 13, 14, and 18 moderately inhibited tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO) release.",
