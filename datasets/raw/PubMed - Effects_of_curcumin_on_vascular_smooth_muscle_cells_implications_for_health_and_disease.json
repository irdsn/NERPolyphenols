  "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are pivotal in regulating vascular tone and integrity. Their dysregulation significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular ailments, including atherosclerosis, blood pressure, and vascular remodeling. Curcumin, a polyphenol with a natural origin in turmeric, exhibits promising therapeutic properties due to its remarkable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiproliferative characteristics. This review aims to assess the effects of curcumin on vascular SMC behavior, encompassing its impact on proliferation, migration, phenotypic switching, and extracellular matrix remodeling. The underlying molecular mechanisms are highlighted, particularly curcumin's modulation of signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear transcription factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways, as well as its ability to decrease oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine generation. Furthermore, we evaluate the implications of the results for vascular health and disease, emphasizing curcumin's potential to prevent or mitigate atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension. Despite promising preclinical evidence, challenges related to curcumin's bioavailability and clinical translation remain.",
