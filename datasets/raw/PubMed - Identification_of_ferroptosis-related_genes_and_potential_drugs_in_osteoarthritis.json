  "title": "Identification of ferroptosis-related genes and potential drugs in osteoarthritis.",
  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic degenerative joint disease in orthopedics, and ferroptosis is a newly identified mode of cell death present in OA. Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine expression and modulation of chondrocyte ferroptosis related pathways may be novel strategies for the treatment of OA. The purpose of this work was to uncover prospective biomarkers and molecular processes of ferroptosis in OA, as well as to better understand the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis in OA treated with resveratrol.",
