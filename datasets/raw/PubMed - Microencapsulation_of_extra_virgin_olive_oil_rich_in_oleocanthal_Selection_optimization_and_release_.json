  "title": "Microencapsulation of extra virgin olive oil rich in oleocanthal: Selection, optimization, and release kinetics by spray-drying in food models.",
  "abstract": "This study identified extra virgin olive oil rich in oleocanthal from six Chinese cultivars and enhanced its stability through microencapsulation. Ascolana Tenera oil, containing 100 mg/kg of oleocanthal, was selected. Microencapsulation via complex coacervation with gelatin and gum arabic, followed by spray drying, yielded spherical microcapsules (788.4 nm) with 70.75 % encapsulation efficiency. Characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and Scanning Electron Microscopy confirmed structural stability and effective cross-linking. In vitro release studies across 5 food models showed rapid oleocanthal release (50.55 % in 120 min) in simulated gastric fluid, fitting the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with Fickian diffusion. In intestinal fluid, release reached ∼70 %, following the Peppas-Sahlin model. Compared to unencapsulated oil, microcapsules exhibited approximately double antioxidant activity, due to improved oxidative stability and storage resistance. These findings suggest that microencapsulation preserves oleocanthal bioactivity and enables controlled release, making this approach promising for functional food applications.",
