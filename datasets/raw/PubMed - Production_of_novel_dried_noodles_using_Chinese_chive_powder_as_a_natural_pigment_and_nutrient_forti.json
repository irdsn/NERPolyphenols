  "abstract": "Chinese chive powder (CCP), a natural pigment and nutrient fortifier with fragrance, was used to fabricate novel dried noodles. The impact of CCP addition (0 %-20 %) on dough processing adaptability and dried noodle quality was analyzed. Pasting properties, gluten index, farinogram, moisture distribution, and microstructure results showed that the high content of dietary fiber in CCP endowed it with excellent water binding ability, resulting in the inhibition of starch gelatinization and gluten formation. This eventually led to poor cooking and texture properties and low consumer acceptability of dried noodles with 15-20 % CCP substitution. However, CCP addition in moderate quantity endowed plain dried noodles with attractive color, aroma, and flavor. The dietary fiber, polyphenols, vitamins, mineral elements, and resistant starch in dried noodles with 10 % CCP increased by 15.3 %∼259.1 %. These findings suggested that CCP was a promising ingredient for developing functional foods with augmented consumer acceptability and nutritional properties.",
