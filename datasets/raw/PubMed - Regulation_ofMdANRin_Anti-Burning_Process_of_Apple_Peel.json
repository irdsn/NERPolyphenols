  "abstract": "Sunburn in apple peel significantly affects fruit appearance and reduces its commercial value. Previous research has shown that apple peel reduces sunburn by increasing the accumulation of proanthocyanidins (PAs) and other protective compounds. However, the precise molecular regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we systematically investigatedMdANR, a key gene involved in PAs biosynthesis. We found thatMdANRexpression in apple peel is responsive to temperature and light fluctuations, with higher expression levels observed under increased temperature and light exposure. Functional analysis revealed thatMdANRoverexpression in apple peel and callus enhanced resistance to high-temperature and -light-intensity stress, accompanied by a corresponding increase in PAs and chlorogenic acid contents. In addition, we demonstrated that MdMYBR9 can activateMdANRpromoter activity and promote its expression through yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase, and electrophoretic mobility transfer experiments. The results indicated thatMdMYBR9was an upstream regulator ofMdANR. Based on these findings, this study proposes theMdMYBR9-MdANR-PAsregulatory model for apple sunburn resistance, providing a molecular framework for enhancing sunburn tolerance in apple breeding programs.",
