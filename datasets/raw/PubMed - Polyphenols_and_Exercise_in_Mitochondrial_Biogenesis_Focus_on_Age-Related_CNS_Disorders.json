  "abstract": "Age-related central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, represent a growing global health burden. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a recognized hallmark in the pathogenesis of these conditions, emphasizing the critical importance of maintaining neuronal energy homeostasis and cellular integrity. Mitochondrial biogenesis, the dynamic process of generating new, functional mitochondria, is paramount for neuronal health and resilience against age-related decline. This review investigates the therapeutic potential of physical activity and polyphenols in modulating mitochondrial biogenesis and offering neuroprotection within the context of age-related CNS disorders. We explore how regular exercise profoundly impacts the brain by enhancing synaptic plasticity, promoting neurogenesis via neurotrophic factors like BDNF, and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis through pathways such as PGC-1alpha activation. These adaptations collectively improve cognitive function and bolster neuronal resistance to damage. Concurrently, polyphenols, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, demonstrate significant neuroprotective effects. They are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and influencing key neuronal signaling pathways, directly stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitigating oxidative stress, thereby supporting neuronal survival. By synthesizing current evidence, this review highlights the complementary and potentially synergistic roles of exercise and polyphenols in preserving mitochondrial health and function in the CNS. The combined impact of these interventions offers a promising non-pharmacological strategy to combat age-related neurodegeneration. Future research should focus on optimizing exercise protocols and polyphenol interventions in human trials to maximize their neurotherapeutic benefits for CNS disorders.",
