  "abstract": "This study aimed to determine protective effect of the Quercetin on experimental cuprizone-induced (CPZ) multiple sclerosis (MS) in Male C57BL/6 mice. Forty male C57BL/6 mice were allocated into 4 experimental groups. Control group received the standard diet. In group 2, mice received a diet containing 0.2 % (w/w) CPZ mixed with ground chow for a duration of 4 weeks (Zhu et al., 2021). In group 3, mice received Quercetin (150 mg/kg) orally every day for 4 weeks. In group 4, mice received a diet with 0.2 % CPZ and Quercetin (150 mg/kg) orally for 4 weeks. After incidence of the sign of the MS reflexive motor behavior and serum antioxidant levels were assessed. Based on the findings, administration of the CPZ significantly decreased ambulation score, number of crosses using OFT (open field test), stay on rotarod, hindlimb foot angle, front- and hindlimb suspension and grip strength (P < 0.05). Quercetin significantly increased ambulation score, number of cross using, stay on rotarod, hindlimb foot angle, front- and hindlimb suspension and grip strength (P < 0.05). Administration of the CPZ significantly increased serum malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) While decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels (P < 0.05). Quercetin significantly decreased serum MDA, TNF-α and IL-1β while increased SOD, GPX and TAS levels (P < 0.05). These results suggested, Quercetin has protective effect against CPZ-induced MS in mice.",
