  "abstract": "Among grapevine trunk diseases, Eutypa dieback, caused by the fungusEutypa lata, is one of the most critical ones, due to its widespread infection in vineyards and the lack of effective treatments. This fungus is a vascular pathogen that enters grapevines through pruning wounds. The infection process is associated with phytotoxic metabolites produced by the fungus, and as such, the identification of new metabolites from different culture conditions and broths could provide valuable insights into the fungus's enzymatic system and help its control. For the purposes of this study, the OSMAC (one strain, many compounds) approach was applied to investigate the secondary metabolism ofE. latastrain 311 isolated fromVitis viniferaplants in Spain. A total of twenty metabolites were isolated, including five reported for the first time fromE. lataand four that are newly identified compounds in the literature: eulatagalactoside A, (R)-2-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methylbut-1'-yn-1'-yl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol, (S)-7-hydroxymethyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1-benzoxepin-3-ol, and (3aR,4S,5R,7aS)-4,5-dihydroxy-6-((R)-3'-methylbuta-1',3'-dien-1'-ylidene)hexahydrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-2-one. These compounds were extracted from fermentation broths using silica gel column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their structures were elucidated through extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, along with high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS). Compounds were evaluated for phytotoxicity againstPhaseolus vulgaris, with only eulatagalactoside A producing white spots after 48 h. Additionally, the antibacterial activity againstEscherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus, andKlebsiella pneumoniaeof selected compounds was tested. The compounds (R)-2-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methylbut-1'-yn-1'-yl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol and (S)-7-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]oxepin-3-ol showed the most significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, inhibitingS. aureusby over 75%, with IC50values of 511.4 µg/mL and 617.9 µg/mL, respectively.",
