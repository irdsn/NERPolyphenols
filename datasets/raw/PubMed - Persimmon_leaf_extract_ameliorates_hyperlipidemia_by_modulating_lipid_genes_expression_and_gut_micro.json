  "title": "Persimmon leaf extract ameliorates hyperlipidemia by modulating lipid genes expression and gut microbiota in high-fat-diet-fed mice.",
  "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is characterized by abnormally elevated blood lipids. Persimmon leaf has multiple pharmacological activities and is valued for its lipid-lowering effect. However, few reports have revealed the hypolipidemic mechanism of persimmon leaf. In this study, compositions from the ethanol extract of persimmon leaf (PLE) were identified by high-resolution liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. The mechanism of PLE against hyperlipidemia induced by high-fat diet in mice was then explored based on lipid gene expression and gut microbiota.",
