  "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and hypercholesterolemia is a central risk factor for atherosclerosis. This study evaluated the effects of Totum-070, a plant-based polyphenol-rich supplement, in hamsters with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dyslipidemia. The molecular mechanisms of action were explored using human Caco2 enterocytes. Totum-070 supplementation reduced the total cholesterol (-41%), non-HDL cholesterol (-47%), and triglycerides (-46%) in a dose-dependent manner, compared with HFD. HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was also significantly decreased by Totum-070, an effect associated with the reduction in various lipid and inflammatory gene expression. Upon challenging with olive oil gavage, the post-prandial triglyceride levels were strongly reduced. The sterol excretion in the feces was increased in the HFD-Totum-070 groups compared with the HFD group and associated with reduction of intestinal cholesterol absorption. These effects were confirmed in the Caco2 cells, where incubation with Totum-070 inhibited cholesterol uptake and apolipoprotein B secretion. Furthermore, a microbiota composition analysis revealed a strong effect of Totum-070 on the alpha and beta diversity of bacterial species and a significant decrease in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Altogether, our findings indicate that Totum-070 lowers hypercholesterolemia by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption, suggesting that its use as dietary supplement may be explored as a new preventive strategy for cardiovascular diseases.",
