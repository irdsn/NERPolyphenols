  "abstract": "The similarity in appearance of poisonous and medicinal plants, such as Asarum heterotropoides (AH) and Cynanchum paniculatum (CP), poses safety risks due to frequent confusion. Since AH contains toxic ingredients, the traditional methods of olfactory and gustatory identification cannot be used to distinguish AH from CP.",
