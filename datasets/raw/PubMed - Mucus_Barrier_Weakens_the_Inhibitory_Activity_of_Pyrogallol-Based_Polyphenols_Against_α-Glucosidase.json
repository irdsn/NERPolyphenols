  "abstract": "Polyphenols reportedly possess strong in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, even higher than acarbose, but their in vivo regulation on postprandial hyperglycemia is poor. So far this typical problem of polyphenols remains unsolved, greatly hindering their application as α-glucosidase inhibitors.",
