  "abstract": "Dictamnine (DIC) is the predominant pharmacological and hepatotoxic component of Cortex Dictamni (CD). CYP3A-mediated metabolic activation plays an important role in DIC-induced hepatotoxicity. Schisandra lignans (SCLs) are the major hepatoprotective ingredients of Schisandra chinensis (SC). CD and SC are frequently used as herb pairs in traditional Chinese medical formulas particularly for the treatment of eczema and urticarial. Our preliminary studies have shown that SC can protect against CD-induced liver injury. However, the underlying protective mechanism of SC against CD-induced liver injury has remained unknown.",
