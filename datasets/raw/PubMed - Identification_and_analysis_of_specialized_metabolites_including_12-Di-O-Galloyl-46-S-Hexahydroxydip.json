  "abstract": "Ancient tea plants over 100 years old are valuable sources of unique-taste-imparting metabolites sought after in the tea market. Understanding the metabolite profiles of ancient tea plants can reveal novel compounds with potential health benefits and inform breeding programs for improved tea quality. We investigated 26 ancient tea plants from four natural villages in Lancang river area, Yunnan province, China, tree' age was estimated based on trunk diameter (>20 cm) and local knowledge. UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS analysis identified two special compounds, 1,2-di-O-galloyl-(4,6-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl)-β-d-glucopyranose (GHG) and 5-O-galloylquinic acid. Significant differences existed between the metabolic profiles of ancient tea plants, among which GHG was highly accumulated in some of them (peak contents (228.28 mg/g) being 2.61× higher than previously reported). GHG also negatively correlated with ester catechins and 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose. We identify various ancient tea germplasms with high levels of GHG that may be highly valuable for the development of new tea beverages and functional foods.",
