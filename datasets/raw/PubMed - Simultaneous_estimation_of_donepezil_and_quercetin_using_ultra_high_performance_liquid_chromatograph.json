  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 55.2 million individuals globally with current treatment modalities only providing symptomatic relief. This highlights the importance of combination therapies which target multiple pathways simultaneously. Donepezil (DNP), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, when combined with Quercetin (QCT), a polyhydroxy flavonoid with neuroprotective properties, might alter progression. However, simultaneous estimation of DNP and QCT for concurrent delivery, calls for robust analytical method that can simultaneously estimate both drugs.",
