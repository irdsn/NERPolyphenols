  "abstract": "Natural substances play a crucial role in modern medicine by targeting cellular pathways associated with diseases. Medicinal plants, rich in bioactive compounds, offer promising therapeutic potential. This study examines the phytochemicals and biological activity of Curio radicans extracts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identifies 29 compounds in the ethanolic extract and 7 in the ethyl acetate extract. The ethanolic extract contains 3,4-Bis (Methoxycarbonyl)furan (15.76%) and 4-Imidazolidinone (14.17%), while the ethyl acetate extract is dominated by Diisooctyl phthalate (49.25%). Genoprotective activity, using the comet assay on human lymphocytes, demonstrates significant dose-dependent reductions in H2O2-induced DNA damage. The ethyl acetate extract reduces total comet score (TCS) from 265.3 ± 20.4 to 33.0 ± 4.3 at 100 mg/100 mL (p < 0.0001), outperforming the ethanolic extract, which reduced TCS from 226.7 ± 41.6 to 44.0 ± 7.2 (p < 0.001). Antioxidant activity, assessed via the DPPH method, reveals moderate activity for the ethyl acetate extract (72.61 ± 1.65%, IC50: 137.58 μg/ml) and lower activity for the ethanolic extract (67.52 ± 0.44%, IC50: 156.52 μg/ml). These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of C. radicans, particularly the ethyl acetate extract, which demonstrates genoprotective effects. Researchers should focus on isolating active compounds and exploring their potential in drug development.",
