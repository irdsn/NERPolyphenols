  "title": "Effects of Iranian Pomegranate Peel Anthocyanin Extract on Physicochemical, Microbial, Sensory, and Shelf Life Properties of Set Yogurt.",
  "abstract": "The study aimed to add the optimal concentration of Iranian pomegranate peel anthocyanin extract (PoPAE) to the formulation of set yogurt. Then, the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory characteristics of set yogurt containing pomegranate peel anthocyanin extract (YCPAE) were compared with set yogurt without extract (YWPAE) during the storage period (12 days). The amount of anthocyanin and total phenol measured equaled 73.57 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside/100 g extract and 2153.11 mg gallic acid/100 g extract. The concentrations of 600 ppm (95.83%) and 800 ppm (96.57%) of PoPAE showed the highest DPPH radical inhibitory power (p< 0.05). During storage days (1, 4, 8, 12), YCPAE parameters such as pH, syneresis, antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP, and β-carotene: linoleic acid (βC/LA) bleaching), and antimicrobial activity (mold, yeast,Staphylococcus aureus, andPseudomonas aeruginosa) anda* index were higher than those of YWPAE. However, parameters such as acidity, viscosity, indexL, andb* of YCPAE were lower than those of YWPAE in days of storage (1, 4, 8, 12). The smell and taste in YCPAE on the 12th day scored high. Scores for color, texture, and mouth feel decreased over time. The texture, smell, taste, and mouth feel of YWPAE on the 12th day scored more points than YCPAE. Looking ahead, the findings strongly suggest that YCPAE will transform its market presence by not only extending the product's shelf life but also significantly enhancing key physicochemical properties. Its remarkable antioxidant properties, combined with its essential nutritional benefits, promise to have a significant impact on consumer health.",
