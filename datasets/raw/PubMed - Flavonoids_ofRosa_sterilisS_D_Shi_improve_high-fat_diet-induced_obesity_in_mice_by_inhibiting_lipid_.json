  "abstract": "Obesity is a complex disease associated with poor dietary habits and the gut microbiota.Rosa sterilisS. D. Shi contains abundant flavonoids, which have significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects. Flavonoids fromRosa sterilisS. D. Shi (FRS) are bioactive compounds with multiple activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether and how the FRS can alleviate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. Our results suggested that there are significant reductions in obesity-related phenotypes after 12 weeks of FRS intervention in HFD-induced mice. FRS significantly reduced weight gain, minimized liver damage, and restored liver and epididymal fat morphology in mice with HFD. Furthermore, FRS increased the population of beneficial bacteriaAkkermansia, which helped counteract obesity, thereby improving glucose homeostasis and reducing lipid accumulation by modulating the gut microbiota composition. In conclusion, as a non-toxic and biologically active natural ingredient, FRS has the potential to prevent obesity and related metabolic disorders, and is expected to become a functional ingredient for researching anti-obesity and improving consumer health. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for developing functional FRS products and underscores the importance of FRS in anti-obesity research and the advanced utilization ofRosa sterilisS. D. Shi resources.",
