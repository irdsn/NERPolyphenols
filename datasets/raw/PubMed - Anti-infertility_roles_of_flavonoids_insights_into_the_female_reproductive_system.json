  "abstract": "Female infertility is a complex and multifactorial disease affecting millions of women worldwide, wherein oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in its pathophysiology. Flavonoids, a class of polyphenolic compounds derived from plants, show promise in alleviating infertility-related disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and uterine implantation abnormalities. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of flavonoids can be useful in overcoming oxidative damage and disturbances of inflammatory conditions within the reproductive system. Key flavonoids, including quercetin and apigenin, have demonstrated the ability to regulate hormonal imbalances, enhance follicular development, and improve oocyte quality. Flavonoids may also act by interacting with essential inflammatory and hormonal pathways to suppress the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing antioxidant defenses. The integration of flavonoid-based strategies with conventional treatments opens up promising avenues in improving reproductive outcomes and advancing fertility therapies. This review will highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of flavonoids and point out their potential as nutraceutical interventions in the management of female infertility.",
