  "abstract": "This study compares the sensory attributes and health profiles of green tea-processed mulberry leaf tea, focusing on different grades and leaves exposed to frost. Electronic nose/tongue, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were employed to assess the flavor characteristics and bioactive components of the teas. Significant differences were found in volatile compounds and bioactive substances across different tea grades, likely influenced by the leaf position of the raw materials. Third-grade tea exhibited the highest concentration of flavor compounds, with pronounced umami and sweet tastes, while lower sourness. Additionally, tea derived from frost-exposed leaves contained higher levels of phenolic compounds, particularly lignans, suggesting enhanced health benefits. Our findings indicate that third-grade tea offers an optimal balance of cost, flavor, and bioactive content compared to higher grades, while frost exposure may boost the health benefits of mulberry leaf tea.",
