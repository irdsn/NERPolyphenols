  "abstract": "Terminalia chebulais an important medicinal plant in traditional medicine, renowned for its fruits that offer various health benefits. This study aimed to investigate metabolic variation in fruit pericarp ofT. chebulacollected from four regions of India (North, South, East, and West). Rapid and efficient ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection method was developed for separation and quantification of polyphenolsviz.gallic acid, corilagin, chebulagic acid, ellagic acid, and chebulinic acid using BEH Shield RP-C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) within 10 min. Method validation was performed in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q2 (R1) guidelines. Results indicated no significant geographical influence on phytoconstituents' content in samples. Chebulagic acid was found highest in sample collected from North India region. Activity was determined in terms of their ability to inhibit nitric oxide release in LPS-stimulated macrophages. This study presents unique, economical, time-efficient method for quality control, standardisation ofT. chebula-based formulations, confirming its consistent potency across India.",
