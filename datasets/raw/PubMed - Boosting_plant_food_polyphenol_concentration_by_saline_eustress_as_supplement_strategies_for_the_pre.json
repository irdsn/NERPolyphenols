  "abstract": "Phenolic compounds in lettuce can increase by the application of positive stress (eustress) such as moderate saline stress. Phenolic compounds possess antioxidant capacity that is a key factor in the detoxification of excess reactive oxygen species. A double-blinded randomized interventional and placebo- controlled study design was carried out to compare the effect of daily dietary eustress lettuce ingestion in hepatic, lipid, bone, glucose, and iron metabolism.",
