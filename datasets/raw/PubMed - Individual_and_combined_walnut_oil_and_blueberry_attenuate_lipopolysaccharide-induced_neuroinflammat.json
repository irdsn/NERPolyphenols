  "abstract": "Chronic microglial activation drives neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. Walnuts and blueberries (BB) have been demonstrated to reduce neuroinflammation, but it is unknown whether they act synergistically to enhance the effects seen with individual treatment. This study examined the individual and synergistic effects of walnut oil (WO) and BB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in rat microglial cells. The effects of pretreatment duration and concentration were also explored.",
