  "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered a significant global health issue related to serious metabolic disorders. However, effective pharmacological treatments are still limited. Flavonoids, a wide group of polyphenol substances, exert anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects in preclinical data. Thus, implementing these research findings in clinical practice could significantly help manage NAFLD and its consequences. This narrative review assesses the therapeutic potential of flavonoids in managing NAFLD. The research collected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs from the past five years concerning the impact of flavonoids on NAFLD. A total of 20 studies were selected according to predetermined inclusion criteria, comprising thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven meta-analyses. The research underscores the beneficial effects of flavonoids in the management of NAFLD through the enhancement of lipid metabolism, the reduction in hepatic steatosis, and the provision of anti-inflammatory actions. Clinical trials demonstrate that interventions rich in flavonoids, including quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, naringenin, and isoflavones, substantially reduce liver fat content and enhance liver enzyme profiles, with certain compounds exhibiting superior efficacy in particular subgroups, such as older adults and females. Nonetheless, whereas these therapies significantly diminish hepatic steatosis, their effect on fibrosis is constrained. To sum up, flavonoids exhibit significant potential as supplementary treatments for NAFLD by enhancing liver function, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. Additional extensive controlled clinical trials are necessary to create uniform treatment methods and ascertain their long-term therapeutic advantages.",
