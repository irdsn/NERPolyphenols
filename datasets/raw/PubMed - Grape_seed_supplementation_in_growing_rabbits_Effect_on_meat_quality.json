  "abstract": "Grape seed supplementation in rabbit diet on meat quality and performance was investigated. The experiment lasted 57 days and was conducted with forty Hycole rabbits 35 days-old (bodyweight: 802.6 ± 2.69 g) that were randomly divided into two groups and fed either a control diet (Control group) or the same diet of the control group in which 5 % of barley and 5 % of maize were replaced with 10 % of grape seed (GS group). The dietary treatment influenced final body weight, average daily gain and dry matter intake which were higher (P < 0.05) in the GS group than in the control group. The addition of 10 % grape seed in rabbit diet increased the accumulation of intramuscular fat (P < 0.05), the levels of C18:1 cis-9 (P < 0.01) and of the total monounsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.01), and tended to increase (P = 0.061) the sum of n-6 PUFA in meat, whereas reduced the sum of n-3 PUFA (P < 0.05), the levels of C22:5 n-3 (P < 0.05) and C22:6 n-3 (P < 0.05), leading to an increase (P < 0.01) in the n-6 to n-3 ratio in GS group than in control group. Grape seed supplementation reduced TBARS values (P < 0.01) and protected meat from lipid oxidation over time (P < 0.01), demonstrating that supplementation of 10 % grape seeds in the rabbit diet could improve shelf-life in meat.",
