  "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous industrial compound found in an enormous variety of consumer goods such as plastics, epoxy resins, and thermal paper. Despite its widespread usage, the effects of BPA on the risk and development of metabolic syndrome are not fully understood. Prenatal exposure to BPA has been shown to disrupt the development of offspring's metabolically active tissues and increase their susceptibility to the adverse consequences of a trans-fat diet (TFD).",
