  "abstract": "Light variability is a key environmental stressor influencing the physiology and productivity of marine macroalgae. This study examined the ecophysiological and biochemical responses ofLessonia spicata(Ochrophyta) during a natural light deprivation event caused by a solar eclipse. We measured the in vivo chlorophylla(Chla) fluorescence, photoinhibition, and photosynthetic capacity, along with the pigment content, phenolic compound accumulation, and antioxidant capacity, to evaluate short-term photosynthetic adjustments. Dark-adapted conditions during the eclipse peak led to reduced photosynthetic and biochemical activity, while post-eclipse recovery involved the increased accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and photoprotective compounds. Carotenoids showed high antioxidant potential under eclipse exposure, contrasting with declines in chlorophyll content and productivity under pre-eclipse high irradiance. This study provides valuable insights into the rapid acclimation mechanisms ofLessonia spicatato transient light stress, highlighting its sensitivity and resilience to sudden shifts in solar irradiance. These findings contribute to the broader field of marine macroalgal photobiology and stress physiology, enhancing our understanding of how intertidal brown algae adapt to dynamic environmental conditions.",
