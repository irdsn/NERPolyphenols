  "abstract": "Aegle marmelos(L.) CorrÃªa, commonly known as the bael fruit tree, is a member of the Rutaceae family and holds significance in Ayurvedic herbal medicine due to its myriad therapeutic properties. This paper seeks to delve into the diverse benefits offered by the bael fruit tree, exploring various plant parts, including leaves, fruit, bark, and seeds, all of which contain bioactive compounds with therapeutic potential. The bael fruit, with its diverse phytochemical profile, exhibits potential health benefits ranging from radioprotection and antibacterial properties to antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. Additionally, this review highlights the limited preclinical studies on AMs' efficacy in treating neurological disorders, emphasizing the need for more clinical trials to validate its potency and safety. Specifically, the effects and mechanisms of AM extract in addressing Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, depression, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease are explored. In conclusion, AM emerges as a plant of considerable nutritional and pharmacological value, with the potential to contribute significantly to the treatment of neurological disorders. Despite its promising attributes, the limited preclinical studies necessitate further clinical trials to confirm its efficacy. This review consolidates relevant studies, offering insights into AMs' ethnobotany, chemical constituents, pharmacological properties and potential application in neurological disorders. The comprehensive examination underscores the need for continued research to unlock the full therapeutic potential of this versatile plant.",
