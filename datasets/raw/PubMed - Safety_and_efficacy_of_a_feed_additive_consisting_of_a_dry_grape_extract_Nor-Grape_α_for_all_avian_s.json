  "abstract": "Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of a dry grape extract (Nor-Grape® α) as a zootechnical feed additive, functional group physiological condition stabilisers - increase antioxidant defences, for all avian species. The additive is already authorised for use as a feed flavouring for all animal species, except dogs. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe for all avian species. The use of the additive in animal nutrition is of no concern for consumer safety. Based on the data submitted, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the potential of the additive to be a skin or eye irritant or a dermal or respiratory sensitiser. However, the Panel considered that exposure through inhalation is likely. The use of the feed additive is considered safe for the environment. The Panel was unable to conclude on the potential of the additive to be efficacious under the proposed conditions of use.",
