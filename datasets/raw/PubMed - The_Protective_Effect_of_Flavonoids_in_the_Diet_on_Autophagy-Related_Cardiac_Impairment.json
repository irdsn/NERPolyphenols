  "abstract": "The compounds known as flavonoids, commonly found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, medicinal herbs, chocolate, and coffee and tea beverages, have been extensively researched for their impact on cardiovascular health. Flavonoids, with their demonstrated potential, have shown promising effects in regulating blood vessel function and apoptotic processes, as well as in improving lipid profiles. While their powerful antioxidant properties were initially thought to be the main reason behind these effects, recent studies have uncovered new insights into the positive effects of flavonoids on cardiovascular health, and researchers have now identified several signaling pathways and mechanisms that also play a role. Of particular interest are the studies that have highlighted the role of autophagy in maintaining the physiological functions of cardiomyocytes and protecting them from harm. Recent publications have linked the dysregulation of autophagic processes with the development of cardiomyopathies, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to present the latest, novel findings from preclinical research regarding the potential beneficial effects of flavonoids on various heart conditions associated with altered autophagy processes.",
