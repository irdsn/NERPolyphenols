  "abstract": "The nutritional as well as beneficial effects of theArtocarpus communisseed on metabolic syndrome complications have not been studied. In this research, the aim was to investigate the nutritional composition and beneficial effects ofArtocarpus communisseeds' phytoconstituents on thep53core, fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein and cytochrome P450 CYP11A1 domains. The elements and phytochemicals in the seed were determined through atomic absorption spectroscopy assay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, respectively. Also, the compounds detected were docked to thep53core, FTO protein and cytochrome P450 CYP11A1 domains protein.Artocarpus communisseed contains sodium (7.824 ± 0.0134 ppm), magnesium (10.187 ± 0.0239 ppm) and iron (1.924 ± 0.0017), while zinc and cadmium were undetected. Phenolics and flavonoids were the most abundant phytochemicals in the seed. Phytoconstituents, such as pentadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid and methyl ester, possessing different therapeutic effects were identifiedviaGC-MS analysis. InA. communisseed, 3-methyl-4-nitro-5-(1-pyrazolyl) pyrazole and phenanthrene were able to bind more peculiarly and specifically to the p53 core, FTO protein and cytochrome P450 CYP11A1 domains. One of the important processes that were hypothesized for the recovery of metabolic syndrome in affected victims is shown by the molecular dynamics analysis, which shows that the binding of these chemicals to the targeted structure stabilized the proteins. Therefore,Artocarpus communisseeds could be a new strategy for the management of metabolic syndrome.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",
