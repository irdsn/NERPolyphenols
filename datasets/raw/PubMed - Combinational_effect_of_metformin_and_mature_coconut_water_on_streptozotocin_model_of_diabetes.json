  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a persistent metabolic disease typified by hyperglycemia, caused by insufficient or ineffective insulin. This study examined the therapeutic effects of metformin combined with coconut water. In this study, twenty male Wistar rats (150-220 g) were divided into four groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic treated with metformin, and diabetic treated with metformin plus coconut water. Diabetes was induced using nicotinamide and streptozotocin (STZ), followed by a 21-day oral treatment regimen. Body weight, fasting blood glucose levels, feed, and water intake were measured weekly. A molecular docking study was employed to assess the degree of affinity that compounds of coconut water have for important metabolic proteins. Combination therapies of metformin and coconut water significantly reduced the glucose levels in the blood when compared to the diabetic controls. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between coconut water constituents, particularly chlorogenic acid, and key metabolic proteins, suggesting potential therapeutic effects. The study demonstrates that coconut water, in combination with metformin, effectively ameliorates hyperglycemia and enhances antioxidant enzyme activities in diabetic rats induced with STZ. These results imply that coconut water could serve as a beneficial adjunct treatment for managing DM.",
