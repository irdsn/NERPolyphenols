  "title": "Composite lemon/ginger essential oil emulsion based on pectin and sodium caseinate: Preparation, properties, and application in fresh-cut carrots preservation.",
  "abstract": "This research developed a composite pectin/sodium caseinate (PE/SC) emulsion system loaded with lemon/ginger essential oil (LEO/GEO), and examined its preservation properties in fresh-cut carrots. Results found that EO emulsion with 1:1 of PE/SC ratio, 1:1 of LEO/GEO ratio and 10 % EO phase had high stability. Moreover, the EO emulsion displayed strong antibacterial capacity on Staphylococcus aureus (up to 100 % inhibition tare), and the antioxidant capacity increased with the increase of GEO ratio and EO phase concentration. Finally, stable composite LEO/GEO emulsion coating was prepared, which slowed down the ascorbic acid and carotenoid degradation and increased phenolic content by 65 % and maintained good color and texture of fresh-cut carrots during storage. Meanwhile, the antioxidant capacity was increased, and the microbial growth was inhibited to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut carrots to 10 days. Therefore, composite PE/SC-based LEO/GEO emulsion shows a great potential application in improving fresh-cut vegetables preservation.",
