  "title": "A Comprehensive Review on Polyphenols of White Wine: Impact on Wine Quality and Potential Health Benefits.",
  "abstract": "Polyphenols are associated with various beneficial health effects. These compounds are present in edible plants such as fruits and vegetables, and the human body absorbs them through the consumption of foods and beverages. Wine is recognized as a rich source of these valuable compounds, and it has been well established that polyphenols present in red wine possess numerous biologically active functions related to health promotion. Therefore, most scientific research has been focused on red wine polyphenols, whereas white wine polyphenols have been neglected. This review presents the summarized information about the most abundant polyphenols in white wines, their concentration, their impact on wine quality and their potential health effects, such as neuroprotective and cardioprotective activities, antioxidant potential, antimicrobial activity and their positive effects on lipids. These findings are an effort to help compensate for the relative lack of relevant data in the scientific literature regarding white wine polyphenols.",
