  "abstract": "Flavonoids are natural phytochemicals that have therapeutic effects and act in the prevention of several pathologies. These phytochemicals can be found in seeds, grains, tea, coffee, wine, chocolate, cocoa, vegetables and, mainly, in citrus fruits. Neohesperidin, hesperidin and hesperetin are citrus flavonoids from the flavanones subclass that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential. Neohesperidin, in the form of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC), also has dietary properties as a sweetener. In general, these flavanones have been investigated as a strategy to control bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. In this literature review, we compiled studies that investigated the effects of neohesperidin, hesperidin and its aglycone, hesperetin, on bone health. In vitro studies showed that these flavanones exerted an antiosteoclastic and anti- inflammatory effects, inhibiting the expression of osteoclastic markers and reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species, proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase levels. Similarly, such studies favored the osteogenic potential of preosteoblastic cells and induced the overexpression of osteogenic markers. In vivo, these flavanones favored the regeneration of bone defects and minimized inflammation in arthritis- and periodontitis-induced models. Additionally, they exerted a significant anticatabolic effect in ovariectomy models, reducing trabecular bone loss and increasing bone mineral density. Although research should advance to the clinical field, these flavanones may have therapeutic potential for controlling the progression of metabolic, autoimmune or inflammatory bone diseases.",
