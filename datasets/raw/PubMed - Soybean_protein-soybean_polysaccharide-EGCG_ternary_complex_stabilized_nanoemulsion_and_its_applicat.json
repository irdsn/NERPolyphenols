  "abstract": "Soybean protein isolate (SPI), soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were utilized to prepare SPI-SSPS binary complex and SPI-SSPS-EGCG ternary complex, acting as natural emulsifiers to prepare oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion using high-pressure homogenization (90 MPa, 5 times) and the emulsion stabilization mechanism was analyzed. The SPI-SSPS-EGCG complex stabilized emulsion with smaller particle sizes that dispersed evenly, exhibiting excellent stability at 25-100 °C and pH 9.0-11.0 in different storage time ranges (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 d). The pterostilbene (PTE) embedding rate of emulsion stabilized by SPI-SSPS complex and SPI-SSPS-EGCG complex increased significantly compared with SPI stabilized emulsion. Moreover, the ternary complex stabilized emulsion had improved bioaccessibility of PTE after simulating in vitro digestion, and it stabilized by covalent complex (28.23 ± 0.21 %) was better than that of the non-covalent (25.07 ± 0.48 %).",
