  "title": "A case of racemiform trichoblastoma in a dog.",
  "abstract": "Trichoblastoma, which is common in dogs, is now occurring with other cellular changes outside the recognized forms to warrant their continuous evaluation for proper elucidation even as their causes largely remain unknown. A case at hand involved a 9-year-old Caucasian dog, which weighed 35 kg with chief complaint of a progressive bleeding mass on the scalp. The dog had an up-to-date vaccination record and all vital parameters were within optimum ranges. The surgical excision of the firm, solitary, and alopecic mass with traumatized upper surface revealed the presence of a well-demarcated and unencapsulated mass composed of grapes-like nests of basaloid epithelial cells within follicular stroma devoid of stromal necrosis, inflammatory cellular infiltration, and neoplastic epidermal connection. However, there was tissue necrosis, hemorrhages, and inflammatory cellular infiltrates on the exposed upper part of the traumatized growth. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive reactivity to AE1/AE3, CK5/6, and p63 but negative immunoreactivity to CK7, CK20, CEA, and TTF-1. The histomorphological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the mass on the scalp of the dog suggested a solitary racemiform trichoblastoma with a traumatized exposed upper part despite basal cell carcinoma mimicry where histological diagnosis currently hold sway over immunohistochemical evaluation.",
