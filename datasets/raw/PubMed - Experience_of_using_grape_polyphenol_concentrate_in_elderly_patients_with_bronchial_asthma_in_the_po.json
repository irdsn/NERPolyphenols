  "abstract": "The state of long-COVID and post-COVID syndrome is associated with the presence of low-grade inflammation (LGI) in patients, associated, among other things, with impaired permeability of natural barriers for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram-negative flora. Objective - to study the effect of adding polyphenolic grape concentrate to the course of spa treatment in patients with bronchial asthma and post-covid syndrome on the state of LGI, intestinal permeability and edotoxemia. The study included 70 patients with a verified diagnosis of Bronchial asthma who had suffered from infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Patients were divided into two groups. The intervention group (n=40) received grape polyphenol concentrate in addition to standard spa treatment. Subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed for determination of the levels of C-RP, zonulin, LPS, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). In patients of the 1st group a reliable decrease in the level of C-RP (p<0,039) and the concentration of circulating LPS (p=0,008) was revealed. In both groups, a statistically significant increase in the concentration of BPI and zonulin was registered (p<0,05). The use of polyphenolic grape concentrate in elderly patients in the post-covid period reduces the level of C-RP and circulating blood endotoxin, which in the future should reduce the likelihood of long-term consequences associated with NCI, including cardiovascular, in patients who have undergone NCI.",
