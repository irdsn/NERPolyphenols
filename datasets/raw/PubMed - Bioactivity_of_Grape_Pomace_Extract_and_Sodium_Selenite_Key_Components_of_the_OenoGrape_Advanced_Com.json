  "title": "Bioactivity of Grape Pomace Extract and Sodium Selenite, Key Components of the OenoGrape Advanced Complex, on Target Human Cells: Intracellular ROS Scavenging and Nrf2/ARE Induction Following In Vitro Intestinal Absorption.",
  "abstract": "Oenobiol Sun Expert, a food formulation designed to enhance skin health prior to sun exposure, has been optimized by incorporating the OenoGrape Advanced Complex, which includes grape pomace extract, increased selenium content and 10% lycopene-rich tomato extract, with these constituents exhibiting high antioxidant potential. To evaluate the effects of these individual ingredients and the overall formulation at the cellular level, the AOP1 cell antioxidant efficacy assay was employed to measure the intracellular free radical scavenging activity, while the Cell Antioxidant Assay (CAA or DCFH-DA) assay was used to assess peroxidation scavenging at the plasma membrane level. The indirect antioxidant activity was examined using stably transfected cell lines containing a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE), which activates the endogenous antioxidant system via the Nrf2/Keap1-ARE pathway. Our results indicate that among the individual components, grape pomace extract and sodium selenite possess high and complementary antioxidant properties. Grape pomace extract was particularly effective in inhibiting free radicals (AOP1 EC50= 6.80 μg/mL) and activating the ARE pathway (ARE EC50= 231.1 μg/mL), whereas sodium selenite exerted its effects through potent ARE activation at sub-microgram levels (EC50= 0.367 μg/mL). In contrast, the lycopene-rich tomato extract did not show a notable contribution to the antioxidant effects. The antiradical activity of the OenoGrape Advanced Complex, comprising these three ingredients, was very efficient and consistent with the results obtained for the individual components (AOP1 EC50= 15.78 µg/mL and ARE EC50of 707.7 μg/mL). Similarly, the free radical scavenging activity still persisted in the Oenobiol Sun Expert formulation (AOP1 EC50= 36.63 µg/mL). Next, in vitro intestinal transepithelial transfer experiments were performed. The basolateral compartments of cells exposed to the ingredients were collected and assessed using the same antioxidant cell assays. The direct and indirect antioxidant activities were measured on both hepatocytes and keratinocytes, demonstrating the bioavailability and bioactivity of grape pomace extract and sodium selenite. These finding suggest that the ingredients of this food supplement contribute to enhanced cytoprotection following ingestion.",
