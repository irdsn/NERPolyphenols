  "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction-induced microcirculation impairment and the no-reflow phenomenon are the leading causes of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. There is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying mechanism of I/R-mediated endothelial dysfunction and to identify effective drugs for treatment. Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid compound, has been extensively studied because of its various pharmacological properties, including its potent protective effects on the cardiovascular system. However, the anti-endothelial dysfunction efficacy and mechanisms of action of SCU have not been investigated.",
