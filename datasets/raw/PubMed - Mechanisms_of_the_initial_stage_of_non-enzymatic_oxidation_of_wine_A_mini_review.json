  "title": "Mechanisms of the initial stage of non-enzymatic oxidation of wine: A mini review.",
  "abstract": "Non-enzymatic oxidation is a primary factor affecting wine quality during bottling or aging. Although red and white wines exhibit distinct responses to oxidation over time, the fundamental mechanisms driving this transformation remain remarkably uniform. Non-enzymatic oxidation of wine commences with the intricate interplay between polyphenols and oxygen, orchestrating a delicate redox dance with iron and copper. Notably, copper emerges as an accelerant in this process. To safeguard wine integrity, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is routinely introduced to counteract the pernicious effects of oxidation by neutralizing hydrogen peroxide and quinone. In this comprehensive review, the initial stages of non-enzymatic wine oxidation are examined. The pivotal roles played by polyphenols, oxygen, iron, copper, and SO2in this complex oxidative process are systematically explored. Additionally, the effect of quinone formation on wine characteristics and the intricate dynamics governing oxygen availability are elucidated. The potential synergistic or additive effects of iron and copper are probed, and the precise balance between SO2and oxygen is scrutinized. This review summarizes the mechanisms involved in the initial stages of non-enzymatic oxidation of wine and anticipates the potential for further research.",
