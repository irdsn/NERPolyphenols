  "abstract": "Phenolic acids, essential compounds in whole grains, are renowned for their health-enhancing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Variations in concentration, particularly of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, are observed among grain types. Their antiobesity and antidiabetes effects are linked to their modulation of key signaling pathways like AMPK and PI3K, crucial for metabolic regulation and the body's response to inflammation and oxidative stress. Processing methods significantly influence phenolic acid content and bioavailability in whole grains. Thermal techniques like boiling, baking, or roasting can degrade these compounds, with loss influenced by processing conditions. Nonthermal methods such as germination, fermentation, or their combination, can protect or enhance phenolic acid content under ideal conditions. Novel nonthermal approaches like ultrahigh pressure (UHP), irradiation, and pulsed electric fields (PEF) show promise in preserving these compounds. Further research is needed to fully comprehend the impact mechanisms of these innovative methods on the nutritional and sensory attributes of cereals.",
