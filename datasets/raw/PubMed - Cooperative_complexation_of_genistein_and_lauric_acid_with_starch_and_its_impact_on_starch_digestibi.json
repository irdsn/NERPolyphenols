  "abstract": "Fatty acids and polyphenols could individually form V-type crystals with starch to reduce starch digestibility. However, the effects of their combined complexation on starch structures and digestibility remained insufficiently understood. This study investigated the structural and digestibility changes in starch when subjected to the combined complexation of lauric acid (LA) and genistein (Ge). Both Ge and LA could independently form V-type crystals with starch, resulting in an increase in resistant starch (RS) content from 6.74 % to 10.30 % ~ 16.45 %. Interestingly, the ternary systems-starches complexed with both LA and Ge-exhibited either higher or lower RS content compared to the binary systems-starches complexed with either LA or Ge alone, depending on the order of complexation of LA and Ge. Ge was found to disrupt the structures of starch-LA complexes, whereas LA tended to further interact with the starch-Ge complexes to increase the content of ordered structures. Importantly, starch that was simultaneously complexed with both Ge and LA displayed significantly higher crystallinity (15.60 % versus 8.65 % ~ 11.45 %) and RS content (21.20 % versus 10.30 % ~ 16.45 %) than other starches. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that van der Waals interactions played a crucial role in governing the complexation behavior of starch with Ge and LA.",
