  "abstract": "Aromaticity in macrocyclic systems arises from the delicate balance of global and local Ï€ conjugation. We report a hitherto elusiveE-stilbene-imprinted cyclic diphyrin incorporating bis-ortho-phenylene units, enabling four distinct conjugation pathways. The ethylene twist disrupts global conjugation while preserving local aromaticity, introducing a new class of contracted porphyrinoid and inducing non-aromaticity. Complexation with BIIIions generates asymmetric ring formation within the cavity, transforming non-emissive diphyrin into emissive in solution.",
