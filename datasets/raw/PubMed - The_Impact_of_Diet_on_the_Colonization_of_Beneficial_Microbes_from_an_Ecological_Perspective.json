  "abstract": "With growing recognition of the pivotal role of gut microbiota in human health, probiotics have gained widespread attention for their potential to restore microbial homeostasis. However, a critical challenge persists: limited colonization efficiency among most probiotic strains compromises their therapeutic efficacy. This overview synthesizes ecological principles with cutting-edge microbiome research to elucidate the dynamic interplay between dietary components and probiotic colonization within the intestinal niche. This overview systematically analyzes: (1) stage-specific colonization mechanisms spanning microbial introduction, establishment, and proliferation; (2) nutrient-driven modulation of gut microbiota composition and function; and (3) the dual role of common dietary patterns as both facilitators and disruptors of probiotic persistence. Notably, this overview identifies key dietary strategies, including precision delivery of prebiotic fibers and polyphenol-microbiota crosstalk, that enhance niche adaptation through pH optimization, adhesion potentiation, and competitive exclusion of pathogens. Furthermore, this overview critically evaluates current limitations in probiotic research, particularly strain-specific variability and methodological constraints in simulating host-microbe-diet tripartite interactions. To bridge these gaps, this overview proposes an interdisciplinary framework integrating omics-driven strain selection, engineered delivery systems, and personalized nutrition models. Collectively, this work advances a mechanistic understanding of diet-microbiota interactions while providing actionable insights for developing targeted probiotic therapies and evidence-based dietary interventions to optimize gut ecosystem resilience.",
