  "abstract": "Oxidative stress-induced retinal neurodegenerative changes are among the pathological alterations observed in diabetic retinopathy. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic compound with diverse pharmacological effects, has shown preventive qualities in several neurodegenerative illnesses, including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and antioxidant benefits. However, its therapeutic efficacy in diabetic retinal neurodegeneration has not yet been thoroughly elucidated. Our study aimed to explore the protective mechanisms and therapeutic benefits of RSV on diabetic retinal neurodegeneration alterations.",
