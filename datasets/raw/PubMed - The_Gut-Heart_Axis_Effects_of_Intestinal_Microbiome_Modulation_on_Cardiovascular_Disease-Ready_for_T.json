  "abstract": "Recent reports demonstrate an association between distinct bacteria or bacteria-derived metabolites originating from the gut microbiome and the onset or progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This raises the opportunity to modulate the gut microbiome to prevent or treat CVD. To investigate whether intestinal microbiome modulation can prevent or treat CVD, this systematic literature review includes all randomized clinical trials on microbiome modulation and its effects on CVD risk published between August 2018 and August 2023. Within this review, we report the modulation of the gut microbiome by a variety of interventions and their effects on CVD, focusing on cardiovascular risk factors and risk markers of CVD. Beneficial effects were observed upon lifestyle intervention and probiotics use. The most promising diets for reducing risk factors of CVD were the Mediterranean diet, high-fiber diets, polyphenol-rich diets, and diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Among drug interventions, only empagliflozin showed beneficial effects on CVD risk factors. Many dietary interventions were less conclusive because of the heterogeneity of study populations, small sample sizes, and short intervention windows or follow-up. Diet, lifestyle, probiotics, or drug interventions can modulate the gut microbiome and decrease risk markers or risk factors related to CVD. Yet, their effects on clinical endpoints remain to be determined.",
