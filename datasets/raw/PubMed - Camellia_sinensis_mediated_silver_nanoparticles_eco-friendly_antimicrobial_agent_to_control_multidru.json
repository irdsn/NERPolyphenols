  "title": "Camellia sinensis mediated silver nanoparticles: eco-friendly antimicrobial agent to control multidrug resistant Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.",
  "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus provokes several clinical infections, and its treatment remains challenging due to the rise of multidrug-resistant strains. In the current scenario it's a vital need for alternative strategies to control the spread of MDR S. aureus. Therefore, considerable effort has been put forth to develop green nanoparticles. Camellia sinensis is enriched with phytocompounds with potent antibacterial properties. Green synthesis strategy is more sustainable and non-toxic compared to traditional chemical processes. CsAgNps was synthesized by mixing 1 part of fresh extract of C. sinensis extract with 2 parts of 1mM silver and employing photocatalytic reduction for the period of 8 h until visible colour change was observed. Synthesized CsAgNps were characterized by employing various techniques to study the size, charge, topography and elemental composition. According to the findings of the in-silico analysis, phytocompounds of C. sinensis including Protopine, Ellagic acid, Catechin and Techtochrysin were recognized as potential lead compounds against various virulent targets in S. aureus. CsAgNps were tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity in MDR and MTCC (1430). The study results showed that it controls growth and biofilm formation of strains at the concentration of 12.5 µg/mL. The potential lead compounds against various virulent targets in S. aureus were analyzed using in-silico technique. Future research in the development of healthcare products will focus on optimization of ecofriendly material with targeted and sustainable release and enhancing antimicrobial efficacy particularly on MDR pathogens. CsAgNps can be incorporated to develop nano-based health care products to control antibiotic resistant S. aureus infections.",
