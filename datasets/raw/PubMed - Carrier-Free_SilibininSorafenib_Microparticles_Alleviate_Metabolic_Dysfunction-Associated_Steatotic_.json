  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease globally. The clinical use of pharmacological agents such as silibinin and sorafenib is limited due to poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and potential side effects, necessitating innovative therapeutic approaches.",
