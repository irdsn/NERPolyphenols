  "abstract": "The structural complexity and limited standards for catechin derivatives in black tea present significant analytical challenges in tea research. This study aimed to develop a systematic approach to extract and analyze catechins and derivatives in Ceylon black tea from four Sri Lankan regions (Dimbula, Nuwara Eliya, Uva, Ruhuna) using optimized extraction conditions, LC-QQQ/MS, and antioxidant assays. A design of experiment (DoE) optimized solvent (0-100 % acetone-water), temperature (30-60 °C), and time (0-150 min), identifying 49.8 % acetone, 123.6 min with sonication, and 49.8 °C as optimal (desirability 0.743). Twelve catechin-related compounds were identified by LC-QQQ/MS, including theaflavins and tentatively annotated derivatives. TPC, TFC, DPPH, and ABTS assays showed Nuwara Eliya tea had the highest antioxidant capacity, linked to elevated polyphenols and flavonoids. This workflow offers a robust framework for studying catechin derivatives with limited standards, offering a practical solution for black tea research and quality assessment.",
