  "title": "The potential of dried Ginkgo Biloba leaves as a novel ingredient in fermented beverages of enhanced flavour and antioxidant properties.",
  "abstract": "Fermentation enhances the nutritional profile of foods and beverages like beer, wine, and fermented teas. Ginkgo biloba, long utilized for its health-enhancing properties, contains bioactive compounds like terpene trilactones and flavonoids, known for their antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. This study explores the feasibility of using dried Ginkgo biloba leaves in SCOBY-mediated fermentation to produce novel health-promoting beverages similar to kombucha. Infusions of dried Ginkgo biloba leaves with varying sugar concentrations are fermented over 21Â days. Results showed that these beverages exhibited potent antioxidant properties, notably higher than tea-kombucha, attributed to increased polyphenol content. HPLC analysis identified significant levels of bioactive compounds such as catechin and apigenin. Sensory evaluation highlighted optimal acceptance of the seven-day fermented product. This research underscores the potential of Ginkgo biloba as a functional ingredient in fermented beverages, offering a healthier alternative to conventional soft drinks.",
