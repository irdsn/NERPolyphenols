  "abstract": "Food insecurity and malnutrition remain global concerns, exacerbated by the wastage of nutrient-rich plant foods and their underutilized parts. Fruit peels, often discarded in food consumption and processing, contribute to substantial nutrient loss and food waste. This study formulated and evaluated different fruit peel blends and assessed their micronutrient composition, phytochemical content, and antioxidant activity. An experimental approach was employed, processing nine fruit peels into three primary blends: orange-lemon-mandarin (OLM), pineapple-cucumber-green apple (PCG), and watermelon-guava-red apple (WGR), each with three variations (A, B, C). The fruit peels were cleaned, dried, de-bittered, and ground into powder before laboratory analysis using AOAC standard methods. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0, with significance accepted atp< 0.05. The results revealed significant variations in micronutrient concentrations and antioxidant activity. Vitamin A content ranged from 9.41 ± 0.01 mg/100 g (WGRC) to 28.8 ± 0.06 mg/100 g (PCGC). Among the vitamins, ascorbic acid was the most predominant, with PCGB recording the highest value (45.3 ± 0.02 mg/100 g). Flavonoid content varied significantly, from 42.76 ± 0.01 mg/100 g (PCGC) to 76.83 ± 0.04 mg/100 g (OLMB). Phytate and oxalate were also present, with OLMA having the highest total phenol content (19.80% ± 0.01%). PCGC exhibited remarkable antioxidant activity, being highest in carotenoid, Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP), and metal chelating activity. The blends also contained essential micro and macro elements, with OLMA recording up to 2.2 ± 0.03 mg/100 g of iron. These findings highlight the nutritional potential of fruit peels, advocating for their use as dietary additives to reduce waste and enhance nutritional value. Promoting their processing and consumption could contribute to sustainable nutrition solutions.",
