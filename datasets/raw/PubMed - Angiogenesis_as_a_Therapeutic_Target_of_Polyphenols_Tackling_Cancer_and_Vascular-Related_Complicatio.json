  "abstract": "Targeting angiogenesis as a strategy for treating cancer or vascular-associated complications is an inspiring field for many investigators. An active area within this discipline is the search for agents capable of modulating angiogenesis in order to ameliorate its structural and functional abnormalities associated with these diseases. (Poly)phenols are a broad group of molecules, many of which fall within the category of natural compounds with therapeutic potential. These potential medicinal effects have launched a considerable number of studies investigating the pro- and(or) anti-angiogenic properties of (poly)phenols in different (patho)physiological settings. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence of the role of (poly)phenols in modulating angiogenesis. This review will guide the reader through preclinical and human investigations describing the pro- and anti-angiogenic effects of these compounds in different pathophysiological context, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated, the key points in the design and evaluation of the effects described, and suggest new approaches to be considered in future studies to overcome the current limitations.",
