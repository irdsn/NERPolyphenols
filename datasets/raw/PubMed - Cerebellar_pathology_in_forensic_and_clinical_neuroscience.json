  "abstract": "Recent research underscores the cerebellum's growing importance in forensic science and neurology, showing its functions extend beyond motor control, especially in identifying causes of death. Critical neuropathological markers including alpha-synuclein and tau protein aggregates, cellular degeneration, inflammation, and vascular changes are vital for identifying neurodegenerative diseases, injuries, and toxic exposures. Advanced forensic methods, such as Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), immunohistochemistry, and molecular analysis, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnoses. Promising new therapies, including neuroprotective agents like resveratrol and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), offer potential in treating cerebellar disorders. The cerebellum's vulnerability to toxins, drugs, and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) highlights its forensic relevance. Moreover, advancements in genetic diagnostics, such as next-generation sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9, are enhancing the understanding and treatment of genetic conditions like Joubert syndrome and Dandy-Walker malformation. These findings emphasize the need for further research into cerebellar function and its broader significance in both forensic science and neurology.",
